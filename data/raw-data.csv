I was fed up with my Nest x Yale lock, which gave me constant problems—connectivity issues, finicky unlocking, you name it. This lock is a complete game-changer, and I’m already planning to buy more for my back door and upstairs patio.The installation was a breeze, taking me less than 20 minutes with just a screwdriver. It’s so intuitive to set up, even for someone who’s not super tech-savvy. The lock offers so many ways to use it—keypad, app, fingerprint, or even a physical key for backup—which makes it incredibly versatile for my family’s needs. It locks with ease every time, giving me peace of mind knowing my home is secure.The app is a standout: clean, user-friendly, and reliable. I can lock or unlock my door from anywhere, check access history, or share temporary codes with guests without any hassle. It’s everything I wanted the Nest x Yale to be but never was.I genuinely feel safer with this lock, and that’s priceless. It’s sleek, modern, and blends perfectly with my door’s aesthetic. I’ve recommended it to everyone I know, and I’m confident anyone who tries it will love it as much as I do. If you’re looking for a smart lock that’s easy to install, secure, and intuitive, this is the one. 10/10, no regrets!Read more"
Smart Locks and Entry,"TP-Link Tapo Smart Door Lock, Deadbolt | Keyless Entry, Fingerprint Recognition, Touchscreen Keypad & in-App Monitoring with Scheduled Access | 1-Year Rechargeable Battery | BHMA Grade 2 | Tapo DL110",114.,4.5,357,https://us.amazon.com/dp/B0DKQQ6Z7Q,5.0,"June 5, 2025",5.0 out of 5 starsExcellent smart lock! Highly recommend!,"LOVE this lock! Super easy installation and programming. Sleek look. Smooth operation. Remote access/control. You can assign codes on the fly, and choose whether they work all of the time or for just certain periods.I thought having a keyless car was great, but a keyless house is even better! No more fumbling for keys, the kids can unlock the door without waiting for one of the grownups to dig out a key and muscle their way to the front of the line. Single-touch locking, so leaving is a breeze - and verbal confirmation of lock status means no second guessing.Fingerprint reader works flawlessly, touch pad is responsive and doesn’t show prints, app is solid and loads quickly. We have a Reolink doorbell so we’ve disabled the Tapo one, so I can’t speak to that.Only improvement I’d like to see is the ability to have the door lock at a certain time (if it isn’t already). It would be extra peace of mind if I knew that the door would lock itself at 9:30pm every night, just in case we forget. I’d also like to be able to choose a timeframe when the auto-lock feature they currently have is active. As is, you can have the door auto-lock a certain amount of time after it’s unlocked, but it applies all of the time. I’d like to be able to set parameters, such as “between the hours of 9:30pm and 7am, auto-lock 3 minutes after unlocking” - again, just in case one of the dogs needs to go out and upon letting it back in, the door doesn’t get re-locked. It would be nice to know there is a backup.Read more"

I've had it installed on my back door at home for about six months now and have not had any issues with either one. The battery life is pretty impressive too, as i haven't needed to recharge them yet. It came highly recommended by a friend who has several of these installed in their house (he's got like 10 kids so you know he needs all the help he can get). I really love not having to carry around keys anymore and the fingerprint recognition is super fast, even when my hands are wet or dirty. Plus, it's nice that i don't have to worry about losing my keys now either. You just put your finger on the scanner and bam, you're in.The app works well too, which is a bonus since I can lock and unlock the doors from anywhere. It's handy when I forget if I locked up or not, or need to let someone in while I'm away. One time i even used it to scare my neighbor by locking him out of his own house (he was trying to borrow some sugar). The app is great for that sort of thing, although you do have to be careful not to lock yourself out too. You can also set up different codes for guests or family members, which is useful if you want to give them access but don't want to share your main code (or fingerprint) with them. I keep meaning to try the bluetooth connection as well, just haven't gotten around to it yet. The lock does have a backup key slot in case all else fails, although i doubt i'll ever need to use it given how reliable everything else is.I would definitely recommend this smart door lock to anyone looking for an upgrade from their old-fashioned locks. It's worth the investment and makes life so much easier. The only thing I wish they had included was some kind of manual override if the battery dies, but you can buy a separate power bank that works with it online (just make sure to get one that's compatible).Read more"

All the Tapo products are a good value in my opinion, including the app which is very good. This door lock is working well so far (a month or so.) The fingerprint sensor works well. You can store many fingerprints and codes and manage them all from the app. You can add codes anywhere from the app but of course you have to be at the lock to add fingerprints. The only negative is that I'm not usually a fan of proprietary batteries so time will tell about that issue. It does have a usb port on the outside to temporarily power the lock in a pinch. It connects to the included Tapo hub which in turn, connects to your wifi. Connecting to the hub instead of the wifi might use less power, the hub plugs into a wall outlet.Read more"

I am glad I did it the ease of installation the various ways to unlock and the setting options is just amazing. It works perfectly in home of 5.

Installation was straightforward, and once it was set up, it worked flawlessly. What I love most is the palm recognition feature. It feels futuristic but also super practical—no more fumbling for keys or even pulling out my phone. I just place my palm on the lock and it opens instantly.The recognition is fast, accurate, and works every time without hassle. It’s been a game-changer for convenience, especially when my hands are full.

Or put in a code that you set, or use the key in the keyhole. I'm going to buy another one for the backdoor. Battery life is great, it has a backup battery that powers the lock while you charge the main battery. It was easy to install, if you're handy with that kind of thing.

I just installed this yesterday afternoon so will update if things change. I fully charged the main battery before install, there is also a backup battery, but its not chargeable on its own, it must be a parasitic draw on the main battery for the first charge, which may be a factor. I noticed by about 8pm after I had scanned the family and everyone had fun testing it out the battery was down to about 68%. I figured it was probably due to the backup charging and possibly the setup \ initial palm scanning, but woke up to it totally drained. There are 3 battery modes, auto - lock wakes up when within 2-3 feet, battery saver - lock wakes up when with 5-10 inches, and extreme power saver - must tap display to wake up. It was initially in auto, will try today in battery saver and see if that makes a difference.One thing to note is that this door does have a screen door in front of it, guessing the lock kept itself awake because the screen door was in proximity, so unlikely the battery saver mode will help. Going to the extreme saver mode where you have to tap to wake up would result in losing out on the coolest feature, just walking up and waving palm to unlock, if have to tap then wave thumbprint would probably be faster, we'll see.update 9/22/25 - adding a star, charged up the battery (which took about 5 hours) and changed setting to battery saver on Friday. By Saturday morning battery read 85% and has stayed there through to today, Monday. This might have solved the problem, will update in a month or so. The battery takes so long to charge that I wouldn't want to do it more than once every couple months, so still keeping an eye on the return window.Update 9/28: drained again, weird this time as I was monitoring reported battery during the week which stayed at around 85%, then just drained overnight again. Not sure about this product, love the features but battery life isn't sufficient.Read more"

It's fine because it just prolonged my experience with it. This lock has been amazing. I don't have experience with other smart locks to compare it to, but I read reviews on all the top smartlocks out there, watched plenty of youtube videos and I went with this one. It's incredible, not just for the price but all the other options such as the 2 fobs in case I have family come visit me, the Fingerprint biometrics, the physical keys as well as personal Pin codes. Not many others had all of those options. The fingerprint scan is super fast and rarely errors unless you carelessly try to touch it without placing your finger directly on it. The fingerprint surface doesn't look like someone would be able to raise a finger print off of it. The battery last very long. The only thing that you would have to worry about is the door not being fully closed, because the bolt will try to lock and a light alarm will beep. If you leave it like that for a very long time, it will probably drain the battery as it keeps trying to close. The app is nice. I get alerts every time someone comes home and opens the door. It tells me the name of the person that is using the finger print or code, so you have a log with times. You can create a temporary pin, in case you are going to go out of town for a day or two and want a family member or neighbor to come and peak on the pets or something. If you have an Airbnb it would be perfect as well. Don't let the price fool you to thinking it's cheap, it's not. Build quality is great, features are awesome. I would expect it to cost more. I'm glad it doesn't. Easy to install and the app was pretty simple as well. The ONLY con would be, if you want to have more than one finger print per person, you would have to add a new user rather than each each being allowed to store more than one fingerprint. You should be able to have at least 2. You don't really need more than one finger from each hand, in case you are carrying something and your right or left thumb is being used to hold something.  But it's not a huge deal at all. The good far out weighs that one con.Read more"

Deadbolt is long and very strong, app setup is very easy where you setup numbers and fingerprints for whoever you want to let into your home. The fingerprint recognition works quickly and the touchscreen responds very well to touch when locking or using the numbers to unlock the door. The motor is a little loud but it seems to be a strong motor that fully locks the bolt so there is no concern that it only went in half way. If it only locks partially it alerts you immediately with beeping, where a successful lock announces ""Locked"". The keys are normal size keys that can be duplicated if necessary but it also comes with 6 keys and 2 rfid tags. It adds a nice look to the door and appears to have been built very well overall. The convenience of a touch to open the door is wonderful and the same when locking it. It can even be set to automatically lock after a predetermined amount of time. The door can also be locked or unlocked by phone when near the door without wifi or a bridge device, but to lock from anywhere you need to add a bridge device to attach to a network...tho i find that unnecessary when you can program 1 time codes for anyone to use and set the auto lock for people you need to let in. Overall I would suggest this device over others priced 2x-4x more than this item.Read more"

However, I encountered a couple of hiccups during the setup in the app. I believe these were user errors rather than issues with the app itself.One important note is that the lock function requires you to hold it down while leaving the house. Initially, it struggled to lock, but I suspect it was simply the system attempting to calibrate correctly.Overall, I’m thoroughly impressed with the app. It’s incredibly user-friendly and offers a range of features at no cost. Notifications are also free. However, before setting up the lock, you need to purchase and set up the gateway first. I’m not sure why this step is necessary, but once the gateway was configured, everything worked seamlessly.The fingerprint scanner and touch buttons are both excellent. I have no complaints about any of these features.The only reason I’m giving it a 4-star rating is because the setup process in the app wasn’t particularly quick. Additionally, I haven’t been able to connect it to Alexa, but I decided against giving Amazon access to my front door.Read more"

I can manage user codes directly through the Ring app, which makes it incredibly convenient.

I finished the installation within an hour.  I pre-drilled some of the holes for the screws instead of relying the the screws themselves to tap the holes; I highly recommend this, especially for the longer screws.Adding it to my SmartThings hub was also a piece of cake, I just initiated adding a device with the SmartThings app on my phone, pressed the ""A"" button on the lock as shown in the manual, and then it asked me to scan the QR code on the lock itself. That was pretty much it.  I can now tell SmartThings to automatically lock the door when it detects that my wife and I have both left the house.The only thing that was a little confusing during installation/setup was the ""auto-handing"" process that takes place the first time you put in the batteries.  The lock will automatically determine if turning the knob clockwise or or counterclockwise is to lock and vice versa.  It does this by automatically trying to turn it each way and figure out the results based on, I think, if it comes across resistance while turning.  I don't think it succeeded when I initially installed the batteries, but when I tried using the app to lock the door for the first time, it sounded like it automatically attempted it again, and this time, it figured out that turning counterclockwise was to lock my door.  In the end it worked out, I just couldn't really understand at what point in the installation/setup process this was meant to happen.Setting codes via the keypad was pretty easy as well, though later I found that you could also do it through the Smartthings app.  I haven't had a reason to add more than one code yet, so I haven't actually added a code via the app but it seems possible. It also looks like you can delete codes from the app as well; but I don't think you can delete a code via the keypad without resetting the lock.  That said, the process through the app is not very intuitive; in the SmartThings app, you don't add/delete codes through the device settings of the lock itself. There is another section in the ""Life"" tab of the SmartThings app that handles ""Smart Lock Guest Access"".  This section seems to be automatically added when you add at least one smart lock to SmartThings, it did not exist before I added this lock.  There you can add/delete codes for any number of locks you have, not just this specific Kwikset 620 lock.  Not the most straight forward UI but the functionality appears to be there.And finally, the physical keyhole can be retooled by the customer to accept any other key that is compatible with Kwikset.  You need a special tool from Kiwkset to retool the lock, which was included with the 620. I was lucky that my current front door key was compatible so now I can use my existing physical house key to lock and unlock; I don't use the keys that came with the 620.Overall, I'm very pleased with this lock, it's simple but does its job just fine.  I'm curious to find out how long the batteries last.  So far it's only been a week, and the battery meter still says 100%, if that means anything :DEDIT: 06-02-2025: It's been about 1 year and 7 months now, and I've had to change the battery once so far.  I don't remember exactly when I changed them out, but it was around the 1 year mark. The lock currently says the 2nd set of batteries is at 62%.Read more"

I have some experience with installing door hardware, so I was able to remove the old one and install this one in 10 minutes.  Then I got to the ""Handing"" section.  The light would not turn green and instead was amber which I took as red.  I uninstalled and reinstalled several times and could not get the light to go green.  I was about to return it on Amazon when I caught Nathan S's review.  He saved the day.  I am going to echo his review:""The lock works great, but beware of errors in the initial setup instructions that come with the lock.The instructions clearly states that during the initial “handing” process (where it tries to detect whether it is installed in a left hand or right hand orientation) that the indicator light will turn “green” for success or “red” for an error. Every time I follow the instructions to the letter to perform the “handing” procedure the light turns amber (which is neither red or green) and pressing the Kwikset button on the lock to test locking the deadbolt results in 3 error beeps. I returned the first lock because I couldn’t ever get a green light after performing the handing process. When the replacement lock came and did the exact same thing, I suspected the instructions were wrong.Amber after the “handing” process = success. However, the Kwikset button will not lock the deadbolt until at least 1 user code has been entered. The instructions do not mention this anywhere (in addition to being wrong about the indicator color for successful handing). I had to experiment based on my experience with previous Kwikset Z-Wave locks to figure this out. Once I added the first user code, everything worked perfectly.""Thanks again Nathan S.  Hopefully Kwikset will sort this out soon and our reviews will no longer apply.Read more"

Easy to setup.  Great benefits of not having to have a key.,"I love the kwikset brand of automatic locks because this particular version has the SmartKey that allows you to re-key the tumbler if you need to.  Since we have these on all the other doors of our rental, we were quickly able to reset this to the same key as we use for the other doors.As for the electronic part of this, the one we got is the Z-Wave version which connects into our home automation without impacting our regular wifi network traffic.  We are able to set codes remotely to allow our pest service or cleaners in by providing a personal door code.  We can also setup codes for family that allows us to know who entered when -- not such a big deal now, but definitely a plus when you have high school aged kids.  Also, no keys for the kids for them to lose.There are so many positives to this that I can't list them all.  The only downside is that it is battery powered and depending on how many locks/unlocks, the 4 AA batteries will last 3-6 months.

The modern design looks fantastic with our stainless steel hardware and blends seamlessly into our home’s aesthetic.The app was a breeze to set up, and we had no trouble creating accounts for everyone in the household. The biometric fingerprint sensor is a total game changer—fast, secure, and incredibly convenient.We purchased the lock during our home renovations and loved the ability to create temporary access codes for contractors that could be used while away from home. The scheduling feature made it easy to allow access only on specific days and times. The app also keeps track of user activity and offers customizable smart notifications, which can alert specific users when certain people enter (or at any time, depending on your preference).It’s incredibly simple to lock or unlock the door remotely from the app, and adding guests takes just seconds. One of my favorite features is the ability to have the door automatically unlock when I arrive home based on my phone’s location.One recommendation: I wish there were a similar auto-lock feature tied to geolocation when leaving the house. Currently, the only auto-lock option is based on a timer, not on whether you’ve actually left the home. I hope Yale adds this in a future update.I did run into some issues integrating the lock with Apple HomeKit. If you remove the device from HomeKit, you’ll need to do a factory reset to re-pair it, which is a bit of a hassle. The lock does work with HomeKit, but I’ve found it to be occasionally non-responsive—though I’m not sure if that’s due to the lock itself or Apple’s platform.Despite that, I’d highly recommend the Yale Assure 2, especially with the biometric feature. It’s well worth the extra investment for the added convenience, flexibility, and peace of mind.Read more"

Functional issues, poor support experience","I don’t understand why no one can build a smart lock that actually works. This is the most expensive I’ve tried, and possibly the most disappointing.The app is garbage, like every other smart lock app. Setup worked after maybe the tenth try. Adding fingerprints is super glitchy and the actual mechanism doesn’t fill me with enough confidence to leave home without the physical key. It sends me emails constantly about the batteries being critically low, despite having replaced them out of the utmost caution. I’ve marked that I’ve replaced them in the app countless times and that seems to do nothing. I reached out to their support team about the issue and they told me to “open the app” occasionally and lock/unlock it. Not only did that not work, it seems like a weird response for a lock that costs $300. I expect to be able to use the lock’s features without doing anything janky to work around some buggy software. Like just tell me that you’ll fix it. When I told them it was disappointing, they did not even respond.There are a plethora of other issues too. DoorSense stopped working after a few days and I can’t get it to work again. Fingerprints are way too picky and sometimes won’t unlock the door. The lock itself doesn’t mount flush to the door and it looks cheap for how expensive it is.I would avoid this lock and look for something else. As for what that something else might be, who knows. No company seems capable of making a smart door lock that just works.Read more"

The very first fingerprint scan unlocked the door in under a second, and after enrolling my partner and teenagers, we ditched the jangling key ring for good (though the keyed cylinder is great peace of mind). The illuminated keypad glows on approach, so punching in a code at night is effortless, and one-time guest codes have saved me more than one frantic hide-a-key scramble.The built-in Wi-Fi module paired with the Yale Access app in two taps, letting me lock or unlock from anywhere and get real-time alerts the moment the kids get home from school. Vacation mode is priceless: a single toggle disables all fingerprints and codes except mine, so the house sitter can’t accidentally let in a plus-one. Integration with Alexa and Google Home means a quick voice command or routine checks the door status before bed, and geofencing auto-locks as soon as my phone leaves the driveway—no more “Did I lock the door?” u-turns.Battery life is stellar. After two months of daily touches, codes, and remote pings the meter still shows 80 %, and even if I ever miss the low-battery alert, a hidden USB-C backup port gives emergency power with a phone charger. The solid-metal escutcheon feels bulletproof, and the multi-point tamper alarms would wake the whole block if someone tried to force it. From effortless fingerprint entry to rock-solid smart-home integration, this Assure Lock 2 delivers polished, worry-free security that makes coming and going a breeze. Five stars without hesitation—my only regret is not upgrading sooner.Read more"

We've only played with the lock for a day, and I'm sure this is just the surface of what it can really do.Similar to other customers, the initial lock that we received was faulty. However, due to a stellar customer support...we received a replacement lock in about 3 days and it has been going great since. The customer support indicated they were open every day for most hours. I can attest this is true...as they called me back and followed up by text throughout the weekend and evenings. I really have to praise this group - your satisfaction with the product is their top priority. Everything worked perfectly with the replacement.Regarding installation, it was fairly straightforward and instructions were clear. Due to the size of the strike plate hole, I had to shave some of the wood for a proper fit. However, this is a fault of the frame and not the lock. Installation took about 5 minutes and 4 AA batteries with a power drill. Super-easy.Overall, I highly recommend this lock. It is great value for the money and provides so much flexibility.

Once that was done, I had some issues with getting to stay locked from the outside, when it says put the towards the door handle, it actually means put the back of the pin towards the handle. Also, make sure that pin is flush against the bolt or it won't work correctly.There are answers about this which helped me figure out the issue. Since getting that pin to be in the correct direction and flattened against the bolt, it has worked great.Only downside is that you can't use the app when you are not home unless you pay for it. If you want to change any settings you need to be right next to the handle. I'm not the best with technology so it could be me being dumb.Also, the autolock only allows you to chose 900 seconds which I find odd but the fingerprint works well and makes it super easy to get in after it locks .Read more"

Ive used the August smart locks in the past, and recently even the newer Aqara ones but these are SO much better. You pay a small premium for these over the other ones I mentioned but its well worth it for how much better these are. Although the aforementioned ones meet different needs for different people, I think these ones are for those that want to maximize functionality while keeping aesthetics intact. The others are too bulky and take up way more room than they should and while the August ones are much quicker to install, and the Aqara has a keypad integrated, these just look so much better that its almost not even worth considering the other options.Home Keys with my phone or watch work SUPER quick and the lock has NEVER been disconnected or unreachable in the home app. Its super simple to share access with other people and the installation is very straightforward (as long as you dont have messed up door jambs like I did). The only issue Ive ever had with these is that it sometimes says its jammed if you haven't fully turned the paddle all the way over. Which to be honest isn't even the lock's fault but sometimes its so close to being fully turned its strange to see it consider it to be jammed.Only other gripe I have with it is that the battery is an odd size. This honestly couldn't have been solved in any other way on their part but an option to somehow hardwire these would be great. So far the battery life has been excellent, its been installed for about 6 months now but I am curious to see how these will fare compared to other locks Ive had in the past.Read more"

I made the mistake so you don't have to.,"Short Review: The MAIN feature of this lock is the Touch to Unlock feature. It ONLY works 20% of the time. Customer support was no help either. At first they'll say this is a known issue and is being worked but no time frame is given on that update. Next, when you show them pictures of where the lock is installed, they will start to blame the location of the lock. I have mine installed in the door that connects to my garage. Simply put: Do NOT buy this lock.Detailed Version: The main reason you're looking at this lock is due to the convenience of just touching the lock to lock/unlock the door. On paper that does sound super convenient! But how about if the lock never unlocks for you? You are just standing in front of your door touching the lock over and over and over but nothing happens. Beyond frustrating and you start to question ""Why did I buy this?"".I reached out to Level support and at first they actually acknowledged the issue as a known problem. Great! When will the main feature of this lock be fixed? Nicole over at customer support has no idea so she let me know she would follow up later with the engineering team that's working on the firmware update. Ok that's fair! She initially blamed Apple's iOS and how it handles background operations request from apps so thus the randomness of the unlocking. Understandable. How Apple or even Google updates their Operating System is out of Level's control.Both Nicole and the engineering team follow up with me and this is where it all goes downhill. They suggest that the lock needs time for it to get ready for the Touch to Unlock feature to kick in. This MIGHT be true as sometimes I am standing at my door 15-20 seconds before it actually unlocks. 20 seconds might seem short just saying it but actually standing in front of your door for that long is ridiculous. Sometimes the feature just doesn't even work and you have to pull out your phone/key/card to unlock! Isn't everyone buying this lock expecting to just walk up to the lock and be able to unlock it without a waiting period? I sure thought so. And this whole thing about having to wait with a buffer is all nonsense because of the 20% of the time that it DOES work. I am simply walking up to it and touching/unlocking the lock and it works. Where was the buffer in those times?They then request pictures of where the lock is installed. They immediately say I have the lock installed in a wrong room and that the lock is only meant for entry way doors. I have mine installed in the doorway after getting in through the garage door. I believe they mean they only expect this lock to be installed on the outer perimeters of your home. Like the main entry door way for example. If that's the case, shouldn't this be way more clear in their marketing or product descriptions? Also, why did support pivot from the whole ""this is a known issue and is being worked on"" to ""you installed it in the wrong room""?They sure do make it sound the lock would work PERFECTLY if I just fixed all the issues they mentioned.

I read the reviews and was a little skeptical that it would fail randomly after the warranty but I rent a house and wanted to add a smart lock b/c I hate carrying keys, but I'm not allowed to change the locks. This was the perfect solution. The instructions were clear but I had a little trouble with the install - it was user error lol, I contacted support through their chat feature and they resolved it very quickly. I've had no problems since. I was able to integrate the lock with Matter to my Apple HomePod and use the app to lock and unlock from anywhere. I was out of town for work and had some Amazon packages run late on their delivery, so I had a friend stop by to take them inside and I unlocked and locked the house for them from the app.I will update if it fails but this has worked flawlessly and made my life easier since installing.Read more"

I wanted HomeKit integration. As many others have noted, it was chewing through batteries. It was also flakey on HomeKit integration. The Yale app worked flawless, but I want all smart home stuff to got through Apple Home. So I waited until the Amazon return window was close and finally called customer support. We did a hard reset, a software reset and deleted from Home. They told me to not use rechargeable batteries. They said the way rechargeable's power was given the batteries would drain fast. I don't remember all the details, as I thought it was BS but I did go but some alkaline batteries. Things were getting close as I had home working but could not get calibration to work. They had me drill out the deadbolt but still error messages. They then wanted a video so someone could help trouble shoot. At this point, I said send me the request, but I was likely to return. I got off the phone and decided to do one more hard and software reset. This time everything worked! I took a risk to not return hoping it was all fixed. Before, I was getting low battery messages in one day. It has been 4 days and no low battery. The software integration with Home is not perfect. Yale did a great job attempting to resolve this.Read more"

Locks were working fine up until I purchased these devices so that I can operate them wirelessly through the app.  As soon as I installed the Wi-Fi smart module everything connected very easily. I was very happy until I got my first notification that the batteries were drained. I figured the batteries it came with were low, so I went ahead and replace them with new Duracell batteries.  Three days later I get notification again batteries have 20%, and four days later again, three days later again.  I’ve been replacing the batteries every 3 to 4 days. It is impossible to operate a business.  I have contacted Yale and they are not able to help.  They blame it on the Wi-Fi. The devices are connecting instantly, WiFi reading is very good.  We have commercial network with a dedicated wifi network for locks only.  Plus we have a IT team monitoring this.  I purchased a total of 13 that is a lot of money and it’s non-refundable?I have to go and spend more money on the older August connect bridge modules that we have used in the past as they seem to work much better.  Only problem Is they need to be plugged in so that’s a bit of a hassle but beats the battery replacement cost.This is supposed to be the newest thing from Yale and it’s horrible. There’s are few more reviews here from people running Airbnb commenting on the same problems.  So please do not buy these for commercial use. They will not work.Read more"
Smart Locks and Entry,"SwitchBot Smart Keypad Touch for SwitchBot Lock, Fingerprint Keyless Home Entry, IP65 Waterproof, Supports Virtual Passwords for Home Security(Only Works for SwicthBot Lock/Lock Pro)",33.,4.0,"7,966",https://us.amazon.com/dp/B0B15DXS47,5.0,"January 18, 2023",5.0 out of 5 starsInstalled in a classroom door,"Teacher here. I bought this bundle back in early November 2022, but didn't get to install it until the last week of November. Since I teach in a classroom of 24 students, I wanted to wait until the Switch Bot Lock ran out of batteries before I wrote my review. TL;DR at the end of the review.I work at an elementary in the southern United States and after everything that happened last year, my school district now requires to have all doors locked at all times, including classrooms. So, this created an annoyance in which the teacher, or assigned students, unlock and lock the door whenever a person or student goes in or out of the classroom. It wasn't that bad until I started noticing how often the door needed to be unlocked and locked, which started affecting instructional time. So being the techy that I am, I started looking for something that would convert my classroom door deadbolt into a smartish deadbolt that wasn't too expensive, since it was coming out of my pocket, and that it didn't need major deadbolt modification to work. The Switch Bot Lock ended up being exactly what I wanted. Knowing that it only installs over the deadbolt, is removable, and allows manual unlocks/locks, whether by hand or key, was the perfect solution.Once I got approval from my principal to install this lock, I had it up and running the following day. Installation was simple and setup was just as easy through the app. The only thing that might possibly cause it to not work is connecting the hub to the school internet. You would have to check if you can use the school internet for that first. That's why I had to get approval first. Other than that, connecting it to the internet and finishing up the set up was a breeze.Once installed, it was only then that the locking and unlocking annoyance went away. I was shocked to find out that my door was locked and unlocked roughly 300 times a day! This sounds like a lot, and it is, but it isn't only students that are coming in an out of the classroom, other teachers, admin, janitors, and so on.I also ended up installing the finger print keypad outside my door so that students could enter the classroom freely, without having to use the doorbell given to us (another annoyance in itself). They know the passcode and they were told not to give it to anyone else. So far, no other students, other than my own, have entered the classroom with the code. I did give the finger print reader 4 stars though since it doesn't really work with a child's finger, hence why the use a code instead. Other than that, it works just fine.I also purchased the Switch Bot Button and paired it with the lock so that I could have full control of when the door unlocks. I didn't want to only rely on the app on my phone since I tend to leave my phone on my desk while teaching.Now, on to the battery life. Like I mentioned above, the door opens roughly 300 times daily. I just got the low battery notification today (1/17). So, it's about a month and a half, to two month battery life span. It isn't the best, but I rather deal with changing batteries every two months or so than going back to locking and unlocking the door.Conclusion:If you're a teacher being required to have your door locked at all times, and you're in the fence on getting this because you're not sure if it works or not, it does.  It's one last thing we now have to worry about. Not only do my students and myself love to see the door lock and unlock itself, it has wowed my coworkers and administrators as well. I would definitely buy this all over again.TL;DR:Teacher installs this smart lock on classroom door to relieve the hassle of unlocking and locking a door 300 times a day and gets, roughly, a two month battery life span.Read more"

My Grandma is visiting and I was able to create a pin for her that she’ll remember because she had a hard time remembering the pin I use.I love the sturdy design an the fact that it has an anti-theft system and a tamper-proof design.

I doubt it can be easier then this.It is bulky, but since it is meant to retrofit almost any lock, that is not an issue. Just be aware the inside unit is bulky and may not meet your beauty standards.That being said, it works amazing, it is reasonable silent for such a big mechanism, super easy to install and setup through the app is a breeze. The app has almost everything you need (I think it lacks some features, but none super important. Just some nice to have things like temporary suspension of a user - but it has temporary access and one time access features).The outside keypad is a complete separated unit, it is also Bluetooth with great range (I can check it on my phone app about 8 metres away inside my unit). It talks directly to the lock. The fingerprint is so convenient.The mini hub is totally optional. It works great if you need remote control of the device (like checking logs, assign new temporary passwords).

However, we were able to figure that out and get it done. I will say the 3 tape that comes with it, isn't that strong and if you over-tighten certain screws it will pull the lock off the door. The calibration was also difficult for us, we had to remove the lock and reposition it a few times before it worked. The app is also a pain to set up as per usual (we bought a different model of this lock before). However, it's just the initial setup in the app that is annoying because of the bad app, however, once you make it past that the lock works great. One thing I will say is that the RFID read for the cards is not sensitive at all. Meaning that you cannot use the RFID card while it is in your wallet, or the back of your phone case, hell you can barely use it directly touching the unit. It's super specific on where you have to touch the RFID card to the unit. So if you are planning to use the RFID card in any meaningful/convenient way I would think twice. It's more of a gimmick rather than actually useful. However, the fingerprint function works really well, we haven't had any issues with it at all. I don't ever use the screen/code feature because of how well the fingerprint feature works. One thing to keep in mind is that the fingerprint reader is on the right-hand side, so depending on the orientation of your door it might be really close to the door jamb. That means if you have big hand/fingers this may be an issue for you. I wish they made the fingerprint sensor on the top or made a right/left-sided fingerprint model. However, once it's all installed and set up, the lock works really well and I haven't had any problems with it at all. It looks and feels like quality. If you are semi-handy and have patience with technology to go through the app setup it's a good smart lock.Read more"

The quality is excellent. A question that few seem to ask is exactly how secure the lock they are buying is and this one is quite a bit better than most with an obvious amount of attention to actually making sure that someone who is not wanted will not be able to defeat this lock. Note that this is a passage lock and not a deadbolt.  I would not use this as the sole means of security on an outside door.Connectivity with its own app is good and the app offers additional functions not available on the lock itself (including remote opening, smart home connectivity and various configuration options.)  A video doorbell function on the app allows you to use this as a Ring style doorbell--you can see who is there on your phone. My experience with this is mixed as the time between notification and the person being visible on your phone is somewhat longer than most delivery folks are actually willing to wait. Nevertheless, it is nice to be able to activate the camera and see what is going on from time to time.The lock works with smart speakers according to the website but I did not attempt to use Alexa with this so far.The lockset uses a a standard inset which would fit most standard doors--if you are simply swapping this for an existing lock, changing over should take less than 30 minutes including setup and programming your face and fingerprints.The challenge with this lockset is that it uses a proprietary rechargeable battery--a no no in my book for reasons I can explain.Rechargeable batteries have a finite lifespan. My experience is that they start to lose charging capacity after about a year of use and batteries such as these can be of questionable lifespan anyway--especially when used in a quasi outdoor environment and subject to high heat and freezing cold over the seasons. Replacing the battery (meaning finding the same battery model) can be impossible and that makes the lock immediately obsolete. If you are unable to charge it reliably or the battery doesn't hold its charge, you lose all of the lock's functionality. becasue you can connect a battery pack to the outside or even use the included key, you will not get locked out--but having a battery which doesn't last and have no easy way to replace it is not a good formula. I wish this was truly a 'smart lock' that could interface with hubs like Smarthome or Hubitat (and not just Alexa) but that is my own particular issue.Don't get me wrong--the lock is fully featured and easy to use.

Phone App needs improvement.","The video quality exceeded my expectations, and I was kind of surprised how good the black and white night vision was. I like that the camera is not super bulky like some of the others I was considering. Very easy to set up, and to pair to the Homebase.Only 2 major gripes that I have with this camera. 1) I wouldve liked the mounting bracket to be able to mount vertically, like up into a ceiling or rafter. And 2) the solar panel mount could be a little longer.There is one other gripe, but it has to do with the phone App. You can ""share"" the system with other residents in the house, which sends them an email that tells them to click on some link in order to connect to the Homebase and cameras. But there is nothing in the email you can click on to do so. So one of the residents tried creating their own account under their own email, and then scanned the Homebase and a camera to connect to her account. And then I noticed they disappeared from my account, like I no longer could see and have access to the Homebase, like it unlinked from my account when the other resident linked them to their's. Thought that maybe this was some kind of glitch, so I just rescanned the Homebase and a camera back under my account, and then it disappeared from the other resident's account. So, now we all just use my account, but there's also the issue that sometimes it will log someone out on their phone. But yea, I'm not sure if we're just doing something wrong, so if there is something we're missing, then I'll be back to edit this review...Read more"

I couldn't be happier with Eufy!! I bought five cameras; S340, S330, (2)S220's and the doorbell cam. This is my third attempt at a good system, and finally a great system.Packaging ☆☆☆☆☆Quality ☆☆☆☆☆Set-up ☆☆☆☆☆Installation ☆☆☆☆☆App ☆☆☆☆☆All products performance ☆☆☆☆☆Sound quality ☆☆☆☆☆Battery ☆☆☆☆☆Picture quality ☆☆☆☆☆Customer service ☆☆☆☆☆Four cameras on our house and one very remote. Set-up was literally 1,2,3. I did Set-up while charging. Each camera (except remote) I directly linked to our home WIFI.All done in the app.Step 1: connect to WIFI, easy!Step 2: scan QR code on camera, easy!Step 3: camera scans app provided QR code, easy!All done. Now mount where you want it.Configure each camera with the settings you like. The app is so easy to use and has every option that you may realistically need. It even provides battery status info. Explore the app and you'll find everything you need. The remote camera comes with a SIM card that uses the big three providers and will determine the best at any given time. I Installed the app for the SIM card and bought a 6 month data plan for starters. I asked a question through the Amazon app and the manufacturer replied within 20 minutes. I only had one question, where does the memory card go for the remote camera?  It kinda hidden, you move the camera head (scared to do this at first) to reveal the slot. My two cameras with tracking do an outstanding job tracking.Strongly recommended!! Eufy is my go-to from now on. I'm not a tech wizard but this being our third system I know what works well and zero frustration. You'll see in my pictures I installed an extention on my eve's to maximize sun exposure. A little paint and looks like part of the original construction.Read more"

They have helped me in many instances of theft and property damage, and they are really good at deterring fees. The DVR holds about two or three weeks worth of footage and you’re able to clip and save videos and photos. You’re also able to access your cameras from anywhere via your phone as long as your DVR is connected to your Wi-Fi router using an ethernet cable. It was easy to mount all of the cameras, although I do wish that the cameras were capable of being positioned in different ways. The night vision works amazing and I can see nearly all the way down my driveway.Read more"

We got an excellent price on it, and it arrived early. It was well packaged and everything was secure with boxes and boxes of cameras, hard-drive and wiring. Install was super easy, since we were replacing our old system. Took my husband approx 1hr and 30 mins to get all the old cameras down (4) and new cameras (5/8) installed.  We were able to use the old wires to pull new wiring through.  Setup was also super easy, as we have not run this through our wifi. When we go through that process, I will try to update the review with information regarding setup and app installation.Picture quality is great day and night, but the night vision is fairly limited depending on light. The scope of details for the cameras are bright to dim where there is little to no light, covering an estimated 10'W by 30'D area. In well lit areas the distance is much greater with clear picture for up to 150' or more.  That is the one negative and would be the one area needing improvement, or there may be  another system that offers further coverage at night.The 2T hard-drive is big but not bulky.  The system we replaced was only 1T and was about 4 in more narrow from front to back.We chose this system because of the ability to hook 8 cameras up.  It also has the capabilities to mix and match so we can use wireless cameras if wanted as well.  Since we were going from wired to wired, with the exception of one, we chose to keep the wired cameras instead of buying all new wireless.  When we get the 3 wireless I will update the review with that info if able.Setting up the system was as easy as following the prompts.  Password protected or not, it is up to you. We chose to go with a wireless mouse of our own rather than use the corded mouse that is included, and it works fine like that.Easy to configure cameras and set them up.  The one area that we don't like is viewing options.  You can set them up with all 8 on the screen but not just 5, so we have 3 black screens where those are not connected. 1 is displayed larger than the other 7, that are all smaller around 2 sides of the 1 larger.  You can also display them 1 at a time that flips from 1 to the next, and if motion occurs it will jump back to the screen and hold there for designated time.  There are other options as well if you decide to do the wifi and internet option- you can set alerts to shoot an email and even contact the monitoring app for remote viewing of every alert if necessary.  The motion sensitivity can be set to certain areas in a grid or for entire screen and you can have it sensitive enough to alert when a leaf falls 20 yards away during the day or less sensitivity so that it doesn't trigger further than 5ft away.  The whole program is really easy to maneuver and the possibilities are endless with this system.Hopefully this review helps. I definitely recommend this product if you want good quality, excellent picture and an easy install, all for a very competitive price.Read more"

It works great and has really good camera quality. The installation process was pretty straight forward. Although it wouldn't hurt to order longer cables if you do order this camera system. We ordered 4 100 ft cables extra so we could put the cameras farther out. It comes with 8 60 ft cables. They pick up well even far away. I would strap the wires down pretty good too to where the wind doesn't blow them a whole lot so they don't break as easily. Or you could bury them indergeound. We did also have to buy a longer Ethernet cable that worked good with the system because the one it came with was super short! We got a 25 foot Cat 6 Ethernet cord. We thought Cat 5 wouldnt be as good for quality and Cat 7 is more for businesses. Cat 6 is perfect for home uses. However, my biggest issue with this system was after installation, I went to set up the software and it was very difficult!!! I about got so frustrated that I almost sent them back. It took almost 2 days for us to get the cameras to detect motion. And we had everything set to the right settings. We had camera 2 and 3 set up but not 1 yet. So we decided to set up camera 1 and then everything started to work right. So just for your information make sure camera 1 is set up first!! We have the sensitivity turned up all the way right now and it is picking up great now. It even triggers when it rains! It can be kind of annoying actually. But you can adjust it to whatever setting is right for you. After we finally got the cameras working good... they have been great!!. It has AI that detects human and vehicles but I do wish that the camera could have advanced AI settings so it would know my face and not record me all the time..lol Night detection is pretty clear as well. I love that it sends me a notification every time it senses movement. It does detect animals as well but it categorizes them as humans. The notifications work through internet from the Ethernet cord. If you lose Internet you won't get notifications sent to your phone but the hard drive will still manually record on the DVR.  And one thing that I love is that if the memory is full, it will start to overwrite itself so you don't have to delete anything or worry about the memory! Overall these cameras are a great home security option.Read more"

They use the Wansview app to view, operate, and configure.Setup is very easy, just follow the prompts on the Wansview app EXACTLY and the camera will be up and running in under a minute. One thing to note is that battery-powered cameras such as these do not have RTSP video streaming so cannot be used with Zoneminder, but they can be used with Google Home or Alexa (I did not try either one).I bought the 2-pack and put one camera outside aiming at the rear entry door of my house, powered by the solar panel and the other camera is inside aiming at the same door and not connected to any power source (using internal battery only).The outdoor cam has a 32G micro SD card installed and is set to record motion events while the indoor cam is connected to wifi and is for viewing only. I've used just over half gig of storage in 24 days in the outdoor camera. When the card eventually fills the camera is set to overwrite older files.Battery life is fantastic. As a test, the indoor camera was charged with a standard USB-C phone charger for 24 hours and on 12/7/23 put into service. As of 12/26/23 the camera is still working and showing 100% battery. Even if the battery gauge is inaccurate, running 19 days so far on only it's internal battery is amazing. The outdoor camera has never shown less than 97% battery as the solar panel keeps it charged even after a few days of cloudy and rainy conditions. Also, the outdoor camera has been set to turn on it's white lights for 15 seconds when motion is detected so it should use more power than the indoor one. You don't have to worry about these cameras running out of power.Picture quality is excellent. The 2K resolution combined with a good lens make these probably the best security cameras I own for video quality. I'm not sure of the lens focal length, but it does not fisheye like a 1.7mm and the view is wider than a 3mm. It's the proper angle-of-view for typical suburban home use (in my opinion). At night the infrareds light up the area just fine and the option to turn on the white lights when motion is detected (and the video then records in color) is an added benefit.I am so impressed by these cameras that, even though I cannot link them to my Zoneminder central monitoring system via RTSP I will use internal micro SD storage and the Wansview app to have a second security 'system' to complement my existing Zoneminder setup. Like the other Wansview cameras I have, these B6's so far have been operating perfectly with no glitches or lockups. I will update this review once I find out exactly how long the camera lasts on it's internal battery. Impressive!Edit 1: I started with one of the cameras fully charged and running without the solar panel on 12/29/2023. On 2/9/2024 the battery was down to 22%, camera still working fine. Then I connected the solar panel, which was not aiming up at the southern sky -- just aiming towards the east inside a screened pool enclosure -- and the camera was up to 100% on 2/19/2024. I don't have to worry about the camera running out of power!Read more"

So lets go through the pros and consPROS:1. Easy Setup and connectivity2. Super sharp image3. great performance even outdoors4. compact design5. Micro SD card slotCONS:1. Useless with recovering a recorded video (let me explain)Remember that Micro SD card slot which is designed to record video.  If you use the app to view the video it will play great.  However, if you remove the SD card slot to download the video this is where the design falls apart.The video is broken into 1 minute intervals. Let;s say you manually recorded an event that was on your camera that lasted an hour and a half.  Now you have to find the folder for the day in question....Then find the folder for the hour (in this case and hour and half... two folders) in question..... within this folder you will have 60 videos (60 seconds in length).....now you have to import it into a video editing software and stitch these 90 video segments together.  so that you now have the video that you asked the software to manually record in the first place.  That you should have the ability to download in its entirety.  WYZE you got to do better than that. Other than that one aspect...great camera.Read more"

That was the only thing that slowed the installation down a bit. After that it connected in less than five minutes. The app is simple and easy to navigate. Getting the app to connect and share with other users was easy also. Right now I'm using it just to monitor so I'm operating without SD card or cloud storage with no problem.

We have one camera in our property in another State and 4 at our main residence.  They are fantastic.📷 Video QualityThe 2K resolution delivers sharp, clear images—definitely a step up from standard 1080p. Daytime footage is crisp and detailed, and the infrared night vision is surprisingly good, even in complete darkness. The built-in floodlight also enhances night visibility with color footage, which is a nice bonus.🎥 Pan-Tilt-Zoom (PTZ) & CoverageThe camera offers a wide 350° horizontal and 90° vertical rotation, which you can control remotely via the app. It covers a huge area with just one device, eliminating most blind spots around my front yard.📱 App & ConnectivitySetup was quick and fairly straightforward, although I did have to make sure my WiFi was on a 2.4GHz band (it doesn’t support 5GHz). The app (CloudEdge) allows for real-time viewing, motion alerts, and two-way audio. I’ve found the notifications timely and helpful, but sometimes a bit too sensitive (e.g., detecting moving branches).💾 Storage & PlaybackIt supports microSD cards up to 128GB, and there's also an option for cloud storage. I opted for the SD card to avoid monthly fees, and playback has worked reliably so far. However, a few users have mentioned occasional SD card issues, so I’ll keep an eye on that.🌧️ DurabilityThe camera is IP66 weatherproof, and it’s held up well during recent rainstorms with no issues.🗣️ Two-Way AudioThe built-in mic and speaker work fine for basic communication, though don’t expect perfect clarity. Still, it’s good enough to talk to a delivery driver or warn off a stranger if needed.⚠️ Things to ConsiderOnly supports 2.4GHz WiFi (no 5GHz).Motion detection can be a bit overactive.No smart assistant integration (like Alexa or Google Assistant).App could be more polished, but it gets the job done.✅ Final VerdictIf you’re looking for an affordable, feature-packed outdoor security camera with pan-tilt functionality, solid image quality, and no mandatory subscription fees, the DEKCO 2K is a great option. It’s ideal for homeowners who want to boost their security without breaking the bank.Read more"

I have ordered many and they all have problems. However, the cameras, when working properly, are great. But you can't get them anymore. So... look on Amazon for the ""5MP"" version which is just barely different but not really. It's nearly the same and it works perfectly. I just ordered 4 more for my mother's house and they all work flawlessly, albeit they all struggle with connecting to Apple phones. The rest of this review was written BEFORE I bought the 5MP versions so keep that in mind. The following review is for the version you're seeing here on this page.Update: So the other cameras I bought that I hadn't installed yet all failed. All of them got stuck at the initial setup stage with just a blinking green light (which is not defined in the user manual). So I had to send all the cameras back except the one I was already using which still works. I also looked in the Questions and Answers area on Amazon on this product and I found out that I'm not the only one going through this. So apparently this is version 2 of their product which is a complete bust. Version 1 worked great. You can't buy version 1 anymore. So... I don't recommend you buy this product anymore. I've taken it down from a 4 star to a 1 star.Here is my original review:This review is for the DEKCO 2K WiFi Surveillance Security CameraSo let me just start by listing off all the things wrong with it. I'll get that out of the way first.1. The screws they give you are really cheap. It's easy to break them. Get better screws and you won't have to drill your holes first.2. The motor mechanism that turns left/right/up/down will burn out eventually. Try not to use it too much. It's not a video game. If it moves too much because it's tracking motion, it will eventually run out. And when looking down, it won't be able to look back up unless you go out there and turn it up yourself.3. The setup process can be a bit finicky sometimes. I've had to go through the exact same setup process four times until it finally took.4. The quality and volume of the microphone and speaker leaves a lot to be desired.5. The cloud option isn't very useful.6. There is no zoom feature. But you can ""pinch"" to zoom on your phone but that only lets you zoom in on the image on your phone. The camera, itself, doesn't actually zoom.7. Even with a porch light, when pitch black outside, the night vision only works to about 10-15 feet at best.I want to say that I really do like this camera. I like it so much that I went from purchasing 1 to purchasing 4 total (so far). I really wish it offered ""starlight"" technology instead of relying on the red lights because red lights attract bugs and thus sets off the motion detection all the time.I HIGHLY recommend getting a 2 or 3 year protection plan. After all, this device is made in China.I recently installed another one of these and it will be a little exposed to the weather. So we'll see how that goes. (edit: has gone very well)Read more"

Incredible easy to install, all you need is a drill and an afternoon and you’re all set. The tricky part was the solar panels but I figured it out.

Also I have had trouble sharing camera access, as you can only share it via Email. Nonetheless still a good system and value.Read more"

They have great picture quality. The ability to rotate their view direction around remotely from the app is very convenient. They connect extremely well. Even with only 1 bar of signal for the one we put at the back of our property, it still connects, it still loads quickly when I tap the camera in the app, it still plays videos seamlessly without hanging or lagging. The 2 way audio works without a huge delay in the audio. It's fun saying our stray cats name and watching him look all over the deck for me lol Okay, that's probably mean, but so far I haven't seen any hoomans on my deck to talk to.The motion detection sensitivity settings work very well. Even on low, bugs do occasionally trip them at night. But during the day, adjusting the sensitivity to med or high easily adjusts whether the cameras are activated by cars driving by on the road, or just when people or a car is on our property. They say the range for high is about 30ft, but I think it's actually about 40ft based on where I have the cam and where it detects motion when set on high. So not bad at all.They have great range as well. I have two mounted in trees at the front of the property, and two mounted in trees on the back of the property. From those 4 positions I can see every inch of our 2.5 acre lot. The range is going to depend largely on what kind of router you have an if you're using range extenders. We use an Eero router which is positioned at the front of the house, and have a range extender mounted at the back of the house. To connect the cameras in 2.4ghz, I had to go into the Eero app, into troubleshooting, then ""my device requires 2.4ghz"", where it lets you pause 5ghz for 10 minutes. (I had to call my Internet provider for tech support to explain how to do that lol) Our range extender automatically jumps between 2.4 and 5 depending on the connection type to the main router, but check your range extender if you have one to make sure it does that... I then turned off the wifi on my phone and then turned it back on to make sure it was connected to the 2.4ghz while setting up the cameras. I had to do that twice since the 10 minute timer ran out after setting up 3 cams. So a bit of a hassle. But that ensures that the cameras connect to the 2.4ghz setting. 2.4g isn't as fast as 5g, but it has better range and wall penetration than 5g, so it makes sense why Sehmua chose that bandwidth for their cams. On 2.4g, these cameras connect to WiFi in places on our property where my phone doesn't even connect.The batteries and solar panels work great together. Even on a cloudy day 3 cameras were all still over 90%. One camera is mounted in a sort of shaded spot back in the trees and it was around 70% on a cloudy day. So they work well. And there is an included USB c cable to connect them to a wall outlet to charge if they can't get enough sun where you place them. However the instructions do say to limit how often you manually charge them like that, so the batteries are probably mainly designed for slow trickle charging from the solar panels.I bought these to replace another camera brand that I ended up returning because they had connection issues and all sorts of other problems. But these cams from Sehmua work flawlessly. The app is very intuitive and functions well. The cloud storage is a bit pricey, $40 per camera, per year, but the cameras themselves weren't that expensive so it wasn't that big of a deal. I got these cams on sale for 80/pair, so I bought two pair. Think I'll probably order another 4 of them for full coverage of my property. The 4 I have cover the whole property, but there's a couple blind spots and I'd like to have some cameras positioned so that they can get close up views of faces at the front and back doors.Very pleased with them. The only feature I'd like to see added is the ability to program an auto-pan feature where the camera occasionally looks to another direction for a few minutes, and then rotates back. They're still great cams without that, but it would definitely add a lot to their value if that could be added to the firmware/software.Will definitely be buying more of these cams. Very pleased and a satisfied customer.Read more"

First off, the installation was easy and straight forward. I would recommend setting ALL of the cameras up before purchasing a subscription but you don’t have too! There is a slot in the top of the camera for an SD card that you can easily toggle between your SD memory card or your cloud subscription! Secondly, when I connected the cameras to my home network and installed the app on my phone I was under the assumption that the camera app only worked while on my home network, I was wrong! I can see activity whether I am on my home network or at work. I can easily rewind and download footage directly to my phone if need be! Third, is my ability to rotate my cameras, activate night vision, talk to intruders from the speaker of the camera and adjust sensitivity settings all from my phone! The last thing that I want to talk about is the solar panels. The camera comes with internal batteries that charge via the solar panels or a dedicated power cable that comes with the cameras. I am so pleased that I am going to buy another set for my backyard and one blind spot that I have near my car port! Do yourself a favor, and invest in the safety of your home!Read more"

Apparently, a supervisor took over my case. She looked back through my emails, saw my frustration - and the problem - and set out to solve it. First, after clarifying a few things, she advised that they are retraining their newer agents in how to better deal with customers who need a little extra help with all the internal settings - because this system does offer quite a bit of fancy features and not everything could be listed in the manual.They are also looking to update some other issues so that customers walk away with the info they need on a more timely schedule. And, lastly, they offered to send us two extra cameras for our trouble - which does indeed show a genuine concern for customer satisfaction - and I must say, I was not expecting that one at all. Obviously, they are truly intent on customer satisfaction - and I feel much more comfortable about the product now.Thank you, Annke. In lieu of the extra steps you are taking to provide better customer service - and the FACT that this system is truly kickass - It's a definite recommendation!!(PREVIOUS REVIEW)Though I've had it for less than a week, the system - SO FAR - is pretty good.  Excellent picture quality, easy physical installation. It does have a hard drive but doesn't have an internal wifi connection - and this has caused an issue - b/c I could never get it to cooperate with my phone. The phone app setup was grinding and just would not cooperate. I installed the system on my large TV and the video is great, though no matter what I try, it won't send emails to alert me of threats as it's supposed to.The worst part is CUSTOMER SERVICE.They offer a number but a human NEVER answers. You are told to go online to CHAT - but when you do - there's nobody to help you there either. You have to send an email and wait for someone to contact you - and when asking for clarification on a couple of setup issues with regard to downloading and saving video - the reply was simply to follow the instructions in the manual. SERIOUSLY?The playback is a bit tricky as well. Playback includes an entire minute before the ""scene"" and an entire minute after it's over. I tried to check if that could be changed up a bit but - without customer service to directly address this - I could not find the internal setting to adjust (if even possible).They also do not specify how long the videos are kept on any setting before overwrite kicks in - but a professional electronics guy told me his lasted about 6 months on continual record. He also helped me figure out the correct way to download and back up the video I needed since I couldn't get wifi connection -and the instructions for any remedy were not available.Granted, most people who work with electronic setups for a living or hard drives, etc., may not have issues. I'm not completely ignorant of these things either as I'm always working with different setups and even built two of my own websites. But, to ME, I had to reread the instructions over and over for clarity - and still, some were just not clear.You will also need a magnifying glass to read the instructions or use your phone's camera to zoom in. The print is SUPER, SUPER SMALL and on some of the setup pics - the images are too blurry to read at all.I would suggest this product (minus customer service) for now because - if it lasts - it's truly great quality video.Godspeed.Read more"

The old system was a 4 camera one, and the new Annke system is an 8 camera system, but this model ships with 4 cameras.  I had planned to simply use my old cameras with the new system to fill in the remaining slots.  However, after seeing the MASSIVE improvement in video quality, night vision quality (IR illumination), and an number of other factors, I decided to order 4 more matching cameras to upgrade to all 8 HD cameras.  I didn't spend a ton and get a 4k system like I was considering, but I am still quite impressed with the quality of these HD cameras (1920x1080).  I can easily zoom in and read license plates, get good facial views on people, and see smaller details on animals, day or night.  It's a huge improvement over the 960x480 system I had before, and for the price point, I'm very satisfied.  I didn't have to swap out any wiring to replace my old cameras, and it was straightforward to wire up the new ones. So far, I'm impressed with the performance and the DVR is SILENT, especially compared to my old one! I'm not sure what some reviewers were referring to when they said their DVR was loud. Other than a minor whir of the hard drive if you stick your head up close, it's dead quiet. Here's to hoping I get 17 years out of this system like I did my last one!Read more"

I feel so much safer.,"For the very affordable price, this camera is unexpectedly amazing. I have never owned a security camera before. This seemed like a good, basic starter camera. It was easy to download the app and set the camera up. The app is intuitive, and I haven’t run into any problems with it. The app itself seems very well designed.The camera quality is very clear. Night vision is very good as well—last night it even notified me at 3 am when a raccoon walked across my yard. It wasn’t even super close to the camera! I included a picture of the camera view during the day and at night.I love that I get notified on my phone whenever it senses activity. There have been a few times where it sensed activity/recorded/notified me, but there wasn’t actually anything going on in the video. However, this does not bother me, as I would rather the motion sensor be overly sensitive than not sensitive enough/miss things.I didn’t know you could even speak into the camera from your phone—honestly so cool!! I am so impressed with everything about this camera. It truly makes me feel more safe/secure. Especially because it notifies my phone when I’m out of the house if there is any activity in the camera. So far, this product is a 10/10 for me, I would highly recommend it. I am considering buying a second one for my back door. This camera was everything I wanted in a security camera, plus even more extra features that I wasn’t expecting (like speaking into phone to play on the camera speakers). I have no regrets about this camera so far. Although I’ve only had it set up for 4 days, so I can’t speak on the longevity of the product. But as of now, I am super happy with my purchase.Edit: About 2 months later, I felt the need to update my review with my current thoughts. I was really hoping that this camera would continue to work, and good news—This camera is still AMAZING. I actually still haven’t had to charge it since I wrote my original review, which is sort of insane because it’s been constantly on ever since I purchased it. I am so impressed with the battery life. I literally don’t have a single negative thing to say about this camera. It works so perfectly. I get notified on my phone the second something pops up on the camera. The app is great, and lets you go back and rewatch recorded events/download them to your phone. I haven’t had any sort of glitches or problems with the app whatsoever. This has genuinely been one of the best purchases I’ve ever made on Amazon lol. The peace of mind it gives me is so wonderful. I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a great security camera. 10/10 purchaseEDIT #2: It's been 7 months since I purchased this. It still works just like it did when I bought it! I'm really impressed by this, as so many products out there start to break down over time. But not this one! (at least so far lol). This has been a good investment. The battery life is still great, the app still works well, the picture quality is still great, and I still feel safer because of it! I like it so much that I came back and made a second edit to my review. Lol.Read more"
Security Cameras,"Security Cameras Wireless Outdoor, 2K Battery Powered AI Motion Detection Spotlight Siren Alarm WiFi Surveillance Indoor Home Camera, Color Night Vision, 2-Way Talk, Waterproof, Cloud/SD Storage",29.,4.2,"12,215",https://us.amazon.com/dp/B0B5GRGB58,5.0,"January 20, 2025",5.0 out of 5 starsMy issues/thoughts,"Not relevant to the product review, shipping and packaging arrived in a timely manner undamaged.I had issues connecting using mobile data. I reached out to customer support, I took a day or two before I got any real response. I was told they were looking into it. I did all sorts of research, and trying very variations of settings to resolve the issue. I have let my neighbor connect and they have no issue using mobile data to view live view. I have unlimited plan, 5G full bars and still could not connect, phone had plenty of memory and was new enough. What it ended up boiling down to, was the Android version. I was working with 11. I now have 14, and I have no issues connecting using mobile data.These cameras are phenomenal, the clarity is fantastic. For the price they are definitely worth it. The app still needs work. There are a lot of things I would change about it. You have to search to find certain things, but wants to know where it is it's easy enough to find.The AI That's used with these cameras is very intelligent, it knows if it's a person that knows if it's a pet or a combination of both, it knows when a vehicle is on screen, when you get your notifications it will specify what variation is part of the motion activated clip. The biggest downside is the camera captures every movement, if an ant moves on a leaf, it captures it. What this does is forces you to turn off all notifications except specific ones like people, pets maybe vehicles. Every motion activated clip gets uploaded, so if these are indoor cameras I would not advise.Customer service is responsive, although, I believe they hope if they wait long enough to give you a definitive answer, you will solve it on your own. If buying multiple cameras on setting them up at the same time make sure you set the last one up that you want to be at the top of the app as there's no way to reorganize the order in which the cameras are on the app so the first one you set up will be at the bottom. I asked if this was something they were going to work on, they said that they would pass the information on to the technical department.You don't buy the subscription, they get three days of cloud coverage, but you are very limited in what you can do using the app. Therefore you will just get notification after notification of movement, by having the app you can have the AI step in and filter through and only show you movement of people and pets and cars, the other motion activated eclipse will still be recorded and uploaded you just won't be bombarded with notifications.I told the company once my issues get sorted out I would give them five stars, they started off at 3, I would have been a two but for the price, you're actually sitting back just thankful it works at all. So for the price and the quality, and they do eventually get back to you with customer support, these are definitely five star cameras. The app they use is called VicoHome. They have a couple different options as far as subscriptions go, ultimately you're better off just spending the extra 9 or $15 and getting the ultimate.Read more"

The app walks you through everything. Something to note, there is an upgraded paid feature that cost $45 a year per camera. Or they have an unlimited plan if you’re going to have more than two cameras I believe it was like $150 a year.You pretty much can’t do anything without the subscription. There is one feature available on the free plan and then everything else is only available on premium.That being said, for us a family of five with not a lot of wiggle room in our budget, this has been an affordable alternative to home security systems.Pretty much all of the cameras available on here have similar subscriptions  required.I do like that you do not have to have a specific monitor.We live in a very safe neighborhood, but one of these for peace of mind and due to issues with a toxic coparent.For $90 a year and just the initial cost of the cameras it’s doable and reasonable.The quality of the picture, sounds, and recordings is amazing.Read more"

I used to own a commercial grade HiDef IP security camera systems company using hardwired installations Cat5e or Cat6 and going from that to a no name brand and wireless and solar you can imagine my hesitation. Im happy to say that I am very impressed by the quality and functionality and ease of use and set up. Many customizable features including type of night vision, motion detection alerts, sound recording and live listening, PTZ and auto tracking but you can turn that off and have fixed positions which is what I recommend. My order came with a bad camera and the company send me a replacement right away and didn't ask to return the bad one. So far I'm very pleased and is just what I needed for easy installation, operation and everything else you need. You have no monthly fees unless you want longer storage time using the cloud but the main unit works just fine and is more than enough for what I want. The solar panels also do a great job in keeping the batteries fully charged to 100% all the time and the battery life is insanely good. its never below than 95% before the sun is out to charge them to 100% again.Read more"

The solar panels do not need direct sunlight to charge, ambient light is enough to keep it charged (so far at least.) Video quality is good and the tracking in really accurate, only tracking human shapes when that setting is chosen (it does not track cars passing my front yard after making that change.)My one big issue is the sound quality, if there is any wind at all it's about impossible to hear anything other than the wind, seems like the mic needs a windscreen. Also, while the included storage is fairly big (after a week of install I have only used 1gb of the 30gb available) it would be nice if there was a way to use SD cards to expand your storage if needed. No subscription is needed (but is available if you want cloud storage).Very happy with my purchase and will be buying an Aosu doorbell camera after my good experience with this product.Read more"

Cameras work well, and image is decent, but not ""license-plate-clear"" past maybe 30 feet in low light.- App seems nice and easy to use also.- Love the ""no subscription required"" event recording feature, and the remote live ""PTZ"" viewing.- Unpowered battery life seems to be a couple/few days, which is decent.- Cameras can run on Solar or USB C power (adapters not provided, only the cables).Cons:- Re: motion sensing - be sure to set each camera's ""Default View"" so it can ""see 'em coming a mile away"", because the camera has a 1-2 second delay between ""sensing"" and ""acting"", meaning if one can run fast enough to beat that delay, the camera might miss him.- ""360° panning"" is true, BUT be aware that when the camera hits ""360°"", it stops tracking and moving, until the object in question returns to view. If not, camera resets to its default position in 30 seconds. This means that camera placement must accommodate that weakness.""Color Night Vision"" means a LIGHT comes on, triggering the sensor to revert camera to color. It looks great, but if you don't want a bright light coming on, then black-and-white night vision is all you get.- Re: Subscription fees... Aosu sort of ""hides"" info about subscription plans until you actually get the app, sign in, and look at the deals, which is a bit shady. Also, it's pricey if you opt for a ""Plus"" subcription, which goes up in price with EACH camera. A 5-cam subscription is like $280 per year.- I bought a four-camera system, but they only offer a three- or a five-camera subscription. So they've either got you buying not enough or too much in some cases. Also, in order to control five cameras on the app, you need to buy ANOTHER Homebase, because each one apparently only accommodates four cameras unless you but the big 6-camera package with a bigger Homebase.- ALSO, not all cameras go with all base srstions BE CAREFUL when buying, if you plan to add stuff later - be sure everything is compatible. VERY confusing.So this is all kind of scrambled, perhaps on purpose to make you spend more money, which is obnoxious. Definitely not the cheapest service, but it does open up some cool features, if you got the money.Overall, a good system, but they're sneaky with the pricing, and there a few ""buggers"" to be accommodated in your settings/placement. Experimentation is in order. Took me 4 hours to settle on 4 good places/settings for the cameras, as the only way to know if the placement is good, is to install it and then find out. Very hard to hold the camera and test placement.Bottom line, it's a good system and app, BUT be aware of these weaknesses and check subscription pricing and component cross-compatibility before buying.Read more"

Setting up the cameras and navigating the app was probably the easiest thing I’ve ever done in terms of security cameras. The picture quality is amazing. Everything is so clear and I love that you can set notifications based on timing. For example, while I’m at work, I set it up to alert me any time there is movement. As soon as I come home, the notifications stop based on the time I constraints I have set up for it. One of my favorite features is Privacy Mode. This will be my first camera that allows to me turn off the camera video once I am home without having to unplug it. My other ones I had to unplug or turn it to face the wall if I no longer wanted the camera to watch my every move. The cameras also came with mounting equipment in the event you wished to mount it to the wall. The cord is also very long so as long as you don’t have really high ceilings, these would mount nicely to any wall. The only thing is the lag with the voice feature. My mom came to visit and when I tried to talk to her through the camera, you could tell there was a delay between when I would say something and when she would answer. Meaning, I would ask her a question and she would start talking right away. A lot of our conversations were broken up where I would only hear half of what she said and she would hear half of what I said. However, for the price of two cameras, I would recommend these over any other cameras out in the market solely on how easy the setup process was and te picture quality.Read more"

Seriously, this will help.","So, this is one of many systems I have bought and installed in my many years . What you will receive is a high quality DVR, with four very good cameras and the hardware to get it all connected. The DVR performs excellently. My old ZModo system looked great on the camera, but playback was one third the resolution, this one looks live during playback. This all sounds great, but there is always a downside, the downside in this case is the total lack of instructions. there are steps that are totally left out of the leaflet of instructions, and intuitive this is NOT. You will NEED and Android/Apple phone to install it. Set up the cameras, connect, and power up the DVR. Before you can do ANYTHING, you need the username and password. Again, no instructions on this step. Download an app called SPD to your Android/Apple phone. Open the app, scan the theqr code on the DVR, or the QR code that appears on the monitors screen when you try to access the DVR Menu. This will give you the ""Super Password"" for the DVR. Leave the username as ""admin"" and the password is LONG and case sensitive. You can now set the DVR up... Again, nowhere is this evident. (You may think ... ahah!, go to the website!... Well, it does explain the steps, but the ""translation"" is not at all clear. (It also has apps that are outdated that will confuse the situation, ""Zosi view"" for example, is obsolete, but still posted). Now, you should have access to the DVR menu, so you can connect it to your router. There will be a screen on the website to set the online viewer up. there will be an area that shows you to activate the ""cloud viewer"" ... my software didn't even have this, but when I checked my internet connection, it came back as ok, and it was good. Do NOT install the ""Zosi View"" app as previously mentioned, install ""Zosi Smart"" app and check the website to figure out how to get the QR code displayed on your monitor from your DVR to again use the SPD app to scan the info for another super password. log in and you should be good to export the DVR info to the phone app. To view the DVR on a Windows PC was tricky, (The software had to be downloaded in three parts, so you know you have downloaded the correct ""Active"" link) ... but the good part is the IT support staff @ Zosi is dedicated, professional, and willing to help. There is NO phone support, use Facebook messenger. This worked out great for me, but be aware, in the US, in the Northeast, their hours of operation translates to 9:00PM to 5:00AM. If you download the ""Teamviewer"" program, (It's got a free version) The good old team @ Zosi can remotely operate your PC and set it up for you. These instructions will make your installation MUCH easier and less frustrating, enabling you to purchase this system, install most of it, and enjoy the fact that it operates very nicely, especially for the price. Again, Kudos to the support team @Zosi, they save the the day! :DThis system is very nice, I DO recommend it, use Facebook messenger for help, be patient, and you will end up with a very nice system, at a great price point.Read more"

For the money I think this product is well worth it. I had one bad camera and they replaced it quickly without a problem.It does require some maneuvering around in the attic to get set up. I also bought some extra cables that were a bit longer. Don't skimp on the quality of these or your video quality will degrade. We have had temps -29F here in Minnesota and these cameras have worked great without incident. No fogging, condensation or failure of any kind.Wi-fi set up could be a bit easier. Not quite plug-and-play but don't need to take any classes either.Pictures show night and day images from my phone that I can see from anywhere verizon has a tower.Again, great for the money, would buy again.Additional 5/7/19: I see reviews commenting on the motion detection. Very sensitive and yet also works intermittently. Set it to record all the time NOT after detecting motion. The If you have the 1 TB DVR it will record several days in a loop.Additional: After using these for a few years I thought I would add to this review.A year or so into this my cameras stopped working after a bit of trial and error I found the power cord to the cameras was faulty. Found a ""not quite matching"" cord laying around the house and that seemed to work just fine. fast forward another year or so and night vision on all cameras and the camera with the longest video cable stopped working. Thought maybe 2 years was as long as night vision lights worked as none were coming on. Bought 4 new cameras and those ir night vision lights did work either. Contacted Zosi and they do try to help. You need to wait a day or so due to night/day differences. Something also lost in translation. They had no more help than the 7 fixes on their website and owners manual.Got to thinking about that cord I replaced about a year earlier. Bought a new OEM cord and the system again works great. If you have night vision or long cable issues check you cameras power supply.Quite happy with this product. Does everything it's suppose to (except motion detection, just turn it off). The hard drive occasionally makes noise if it restarts like when the power goes out but at this price can have a spare. NO MONTHLY OR YEARLY SUBSCRIPTION. YAY!Read more"

Security Cameras,"WYZE Cam Pan v3 Indoor/Outdoor IP65-Rated 1080p Pan/Tilt/Zoom Wi-Fi Smart Home Security Camera with Color Night Vision, 2-Way Audio, Compatible with Alexa & Google Assistant, White, 2-Pack",64.,4.3,"28,025",https://us.amazon.com/dp/B0BWSPP9HH,5.0,"September 13, 2025",5.0 out of 5 starsIncredible function and performance for the cost,"Bought two Wyze cameras - this one and the stationary cam v4. The tilt on this one is nice but I honestly keep it stationary most of the time so prefer the higher-quality stationary ones, but my use case is also on-demand monitoring and the space is small enough that the camera doesn't need to move. So if you've got other needs - security or a large space, this is likely a great choice. Just know that 1080 quality does start to look a little underwhelming over distance.Gonna copy/paste what I said about the other camera:The two-way communication is actually pretty awesome - for as small as it is the camera's mic pics up decent audio. I did find that if you're on the monitoring end and want to speak through the camera you should do so slowly and deliberately as it takes a half-second for the speaker on the camera to kick on and broadcast; it cuts you off a little so just make sure you enunciate. Night mode is neat but I never use it.I use this for on-demand monitoring rather than 24/7 security so I had to look up how to disable certain things (motion tracking boxes, automatic light/alarm, etc.) but all were, blessedly, able to be disabled. Other reviews said those settings sometimes mysteriously come back on but I haven't experienced it, but had this operational for only about 20 days now.Having had this installed for over two week I've had none of the problems others spoke about. App is surprisingly functional and stable. I wish there were a ""refresh"" button in it as I had to close it out and re-open a couple of times to catch up to a live feed, but other than that no big deal.I will say they REALLY like to push notifications, access to your device, and upsell their cloud service. You can always hit no, but the popups are recurrent - I've had several in the ~20 days of use so far, so likely every few days you'll be asked if you're *REALLY* sure you don't want to buy online storage.Cameras haven't disconnected at all. Again, had to restart the app a few times but they were never unavailable to me. Unless I got lucky with these units I'm guessing they ironed out the problems people were having and/or the issues folks experience are because the cameras are on the periphery of WiFi - these do take a lot of data and so a strong, consistent signal is necessary.If you're monitoring these remotely on cell signal, know you'll need a good 5G signal to get an uninterrupted live feed. If you're low on bars or busted down to LTE you'll get some chop, maybe serious chop, depending on how hairy your connection is. These are essentially like streaming Netflix so again strong, consistent data is key if you want a truly live monitor.All in all, for the price, I'm honestly blown away. They have to be making near-zero on the hardware and using cloud subscriptions to subsidize selling the units, which would explain the constant badgering to sign up. But in the end that just means I get a really serviceable entry-level camera for the cost of a nice lunch.Read more"

We use the cameras for our dog during the day.This camera is quite impressive for the price. Picture quality is excellent, and the motors are quiet when moving around, so they do not disturb or wake our dog. It was easy to set up: download the app, plug it in, scan the QR, follow the instructions, and voila! It is a lot smarter than what we're used to, so it required a little learning, but overall, it's a really nice little camera. We don't need to record, but a friend told us you can get a high GB SD card, so it can easily record and store your videos if required. Also, it is nice to be able to control the camera to turn to where we want to see, AND unlike SimpliSafe cameras, it hasn't disconnected randomly if we wanted to monitor for a long period. That was one of the pet peeves about SimpliSafe.Highly recommended for home monitoring. Definitely will be switching out SimpliSafe cameras to this.Read more"

Do note that the cable is a micro-USB 2.0, so pretty much an older charger from a smartphone will work just fine, however I do recommend you use the included cable since it was specifically designed with weatherproofing in mind.Just like other Wyze cameras, this one is almost a plug-n-play. All you really need to do beforehand is to download the Wyze app that's available in the Apple App Store or Google Play store and create an account if you don't have one. The app itself is self-explanatory and will walk you through the entire setup process.Once you're setup, you can see all the features.Some notable ones include:- 360-degree rotation- Pan-Tilt-Digital Zoom- Privacy Mode- Scan Mode- Time lapse- Colored Night Vision- Motion and Face detection-Speaker/Siren/MicrophoneAnd more passive features include:- Localized SD Card- Ceiling Mounting Solutions (1/4 Thread means it can be mounted to a tri-pod)- Weather-proofMy personal favorites are the Colored Night Vision and the Time Lapse. Colored Night Vision is especially my favorite as it mostly does away with dealing with black & white night security footage. This can be helpful if you need to look at special details when investigating using the Wyze, such as color of a vehicle, or the color of lights of a vehicle driving by (This was especially helpful when identifying emergency vehicles).Time Lapse was another favorite as you can dictate the time span of how long you want to record a session. This was especially helpful for me when using the camera as a fun camera that could be used when recording mass gatherings like a party or a convention.Video Quality is more of a even playing field. Its a 1080p camera, so you get the quality of 1080p footage. It is good quality, but there are so many other options of similar performance.Why 4-stars?For me to put it at four stars despite enjoying this product very much falls short of one thing: Limitations of the app.Unfortunately, if you want the full amazing experience if requires great software, but that great software is half-way locked behind a subscription. Now don't get me wrong, the subscription known as ""Cam Plus"" is actually a good deal at $2.99/month or $19.99/year (price based on the time this review came out), but I'm a big fan of not paying a subscription at all; personally I'd like that ~$3 to go to my next cup of coffee. Despite the limited experience of not buying a subscription, there's a reason why Wyze cameras became my go to security solution. It's COMPLETELY OPTIONAL.In its free version in the app, you go as basic as motion notifications and occasional few-second recordings just to get a general idea of what event is happening in your security camera, which is more than enough of features for me. Be aware that you will need a micro-SD card to help with recordings since cloud storage is very limited.The Final thing to discuss is... why bother looking at the V3 when the  V4 is already available? The V4 has all the features I mentioned above, but its newer, faster, has an upgrade from a 1080p sensor to 4k sensor, and is similarly priced. Might as well go for the latest model, but if you specifically wanted the (comparably) older security camera, the Pan V3 is my go-to.Read more"

After experiencing firsthand how easy it was to integrate them into my existing and very average home Wi-Fi system - not to mention tie their control into existing Amazon smart devices such as my Echo Dot and EchoPop - I simply couldn't resist the urge to (join the rest of you in the 21st century and) purchase a camera.APPLICATION: I wanted an easy to buy, implement, use and maintain a remote controllable and reasonably 'smart' surveillance system - just to keep an eye on things that happen on the street. I learned very quickly the Kasa camera system has features that enable it to not only track motion but specifically people when desired (see Activity Zones IMG) ; features include various levels of tracking up to and including ""Patrol Mode"" which will cause the camera to rotate through the four savable ""scenes"" at the specified interval(s) allowing for 360° monitoring from just one camera. Even has NIGHT VISION.I actually bought two cameras and haven't even set up the second one because the first is already doing so much!TIPS & TRICKS: Make sure you purchase a reasonable quality 64 GB mini SD card. That is the maximum size card this model of Kasa camera can utilize. TO INSERT THE CARD: using the mobile interface pan the camera upward until the mini SD card port and reset buttons are exposed (see IMGs.) Insert the card LABEL UP and press until firmly clicked and secured in its final position. I have been running the camera ""24/7"" (the actual mode is known as ""24/7 Monitoring"") at maximum resolution of 1080p for ~ 3 days and have used less than 25% of the 64 GB capacity. (see IMGs)HOW TO SAVE EVIDENCE: Should something unfortunate occur and you find yourself in the position of needing to save that which your camera captured you can simply click on ""24/7 recording"" & move the saved timeline bar to the requisite point, wait for playback to start and click the 🔴 in the lower right-hand portion on the playback screen. (Note: Give the video recall some time - after all it is the camera having to go back and read saved data while still recording and saving new data, transmit saved data through the Wi-Fi network to your phone and ultimately save it in a new location. Even the fastest systems will take a moment.) Following these steps will save a video of what was recorded that you will find in your video gallery. *There is a portion of the app allocated to Activity Alerts Tracking which is available with a Kasa Care subscription; I do not have that subscription thus I am unable to speak to those features at this time but imagine they facilitate easier activity recall and saving.WHAT TO DO NOW: Click purchase. 😊 Seriously this thing is fabulous especially for the price point. Off the top of my head some of the easiest applications I can think of would be keeping an eye on your pets or your kids while they're at home or having an extra pair of eyes when needed.*** Keep in mind this review is written from the standpoint of someone seeking easy applications and easy use - If you are looking for something that is sturdy, has own/redundant power, data storage and signaling capacity, is designed to survive not only adverse weather/climate but also potential tampering this is not the device I would recommend.Read more"

I do however, have a few slight issues... This one (1080p model) has a different port for power. Which is okay, but definitely going to be a little more difficult to find replacements for. The range of motion on this model is also very strange; you can manually move it to certain points but that changes the movement you can do with the app functions. I got this one as a refurbished model, but I don't think there's a difference, as I also bought a brand new 2k model, and it seems to be the same. Which brings me to my next point; the video quality of the 2k version, compared to the 1080p version seems to be exactly the same, especially when it is in motion. There are several quality drops (even on 1gbps internet speeds and phone on WiFi). All-in-all I would probably buy another of these cameras if I needed it, just for the movements and alerts, at the price they are right now.Read more"

To make matters worse it costs $45 which is the most expensive brick I ever owned in my life so I returned it for a full refund and decided to try 1 more time with a cheaper but comparable camera. That's when I picked this up.I went in a skeptic assuming I would have the same problems as I always did with WYZE(tried a v3 or maybe v2 years ago, same problem as the v4 so I guess WYZE is just incapable of actual improvement and favors dumb gimmicks instead. The only thing that changed was the app layout which admittedly LOOKS better now but looks can be deceiving...)Turns out I was wrong and NOT every camera on Amazon is an overpriced pile of junk! This camera is half the price, connected immediately with 0 delays and functions exactly as advertised. This cameras App has performed nearly perfectly and I can even move this camera FAR from my router without any impact on the signal quality. I can keep my phone on 5G and STILL use EVERY feature on the app. I can also be far away from my router, house, and this camera without losing any features. That means I can get notified of activities, pan/tilt manually, toggle NV, change app settings/schedules, set up to 4 viewpoints, set detection zones in said viewpoints, record manually, turn the status LED on/off, download recorded activities(manual recordings OR detection-based recordings) and Etc...The cloud service is cheap but in a GOOD way. Only $3/month per device(up to 4) or $10/month for up to 10 devices which is extremely affordable.The quality of videos is very good IMO although I do wish the Frame rate was a little higher(I don't KNOW the exact Frame Rate but I'm a big time Gamer who just loves loves LOVES to toggle his FPS display ON and set it to high accuracy mode.) Based on what I have seen so far I think it's about 10-15 FPS so really fast movements will look like a smudge but natural movements shouldn't have that problem. It might not be the BEST option for monitoring(I don't know WHAT is cause this is only my 3rd attempt at finding a decent camera for basic monitoring but it's gone above and beyond my expectations at this pricepoint.) I'm actually about to get 2 or 3 more of these once I finish and submit my updated review.Some notes:When you plug it in for the first time it will probably start moving suddenly on it's own, this is NORMAL. It's a way to test the motor and range of motion for the pan/tilt feature and can be done manually in the app as well. I've moved to different outlets twice now and it has not done that on it's own either time leading me to believe it's only a one-time automated check up of sorts.By coincidence, I found one minor flaw on the app which I'm not sure was a fluke or an actual Bug. I was watching a live video feed and tried to manually record something I wasn't sure would trigger motion detection but apparently it DID and my fool self forgot about the minor delay so it popped up in my notification panel ""Activity detected on ___"" but did not appear in the app right away so I refreshed it.

Just don’t expect cinematic quality video—or to easily share access with anyone else.⸻My ExperienceI bought this little camera mainly for indoor security, and it’s done a decent job so far. It’s so compact and cute that it looks more like a tiny robot pet than a camera. Bonus: the white color blends nicely into my white walls, so it doesn’t scream “surveillance.”The app is user-friendly, and I appreciate the motion-detection recordings. The 6-foot power cord was a pleasant surprise—long enough to reach my high wall outlets without extension cables.That said, video quality leaves something to be desired. It’s supposed to be 1080p, but it feels closer to “meh-720p” in certain lighting conditions. And here’s the kicker: you can’t actually share access with other Amazon accounts. I thought I was just missing something, but nope—it’s by design. You need to log in with the same Blink account across all devices if you want others to access the camera feed.⸻Pros and ConsPros:• Super compact and adorable design—blends in almost too well• Matches white walls perfectly, no visual clutter• App-based recording and motion alerts work smoothly• Comes with a surprisingly long power cable (about 6 feet!)Cons:• Video quality is a bit soft, especially in dim lighting• Can’t share camera access with other Amazon/Blink accounts(you have to share your login credentials to allow access from another device)⸻Tips & Reality CheckIf you were hoping to invite your partner or housemate to view the feed from their own account: sorry, not happening. Blink doesn’t support multi-user permissions. The only workaround is logging into the same account on multiple devices—functional, but not ideal for privacy.Also, if image quality is important to you, consider checking out the Blink Mini 2—it offers better low-light performance and wider field of view.⸻Final VerdictIf you’re looking for a basic, affordable indoor camera with just enough features to feel tech-savvy, the Blink Mini is a solid choice. It’s perfect for keeping an eye on pets, packages, or just giving your room a digital bouncer.Just keep in mind: it’s not built for video buffs or anyone hoping for multi-user access. For solo use? It’s a small but mighty helper.Read more"

We just got our echo a few months ago. I’ve been a prime member for over 10 years so I’m familiar with how amazon has changed life as we knew it (for me anyway). I saw the amazon smart plug when I was searching for any brand smart plug that had Alexa control with it. It’s been in my cart saved for later for at least a month! I finally decided to just pre order it so that I could review it and hopefully help other people that are like me and have fallen way behind in the tech field. For reference I’m an almost 34 year old mom of 2. This means that my 8 year old stole my iPad, iMac, and I haven’t had a computer of my own in about 4 years! So I do everything from my iPhone. I’ve had some weird issues with our echo and my Alexa app that it will just randomly pause a song so I’m not sure what that is about.ANYWAY! I received my new amazon smart plug the day it was released (so glad it’s not like a new iPhone or PlayStation where people camp out ahead of time or do people still do this??). It was easier than I expected but harder than was described in the listing because my Alexa didn’t just recognize it.Setup:Since my Alexa didn’t recognize it on its own, I had to unplug the smart plug and quickly scan the code on the back of the plug, then plug it back in fast so that when it scanned for it it would see it plugged in. After that it was very simple. I was able to plug in my baby monitor and then tell Alexa to “turn off plug one” and it turned off! It is so cool!Future:I think homes will end up being built with these right into the electrical system. Maybe they already are.Comparing:With so many different brands offering smart plugs with Alexa integration I can’t see myself buying any more than 1 for $25.  Too many are 2 for $20. While it’s nice to have the amazon support backing this up, I just can’t afford to fill my home with them at such a high cost comparative to other brands that do the same exact thing.Overall:If you can afford to fill your plugs with these then do! This smart plug is easy and awesome!

It was SO EASY. If you already have alexa set up on your network, you can use your cell phone and set these up in just a FEW minutes. No frustration, no retries. Also unlike the Kasa plugs, these amazon plugs do not hog the entire outlet. Bulky, fat Kasa plugs went into the trash.Read more"

But after buying the Kasa Smart Plug Power Strip HS300, I now feel like the kind of person who irons their socks and alphabetizes their spice rack. This thing is that organized.First impressions? It’s sleek, white, and looks like the kind of gadget a Bond villain would use to power their espresso machine and laser cannon. It even stands up nicely on its side — which is great if you want to pretend your surge protector is striking a heroic pose while managing your chaotic cable jungle.Actual Features That Surprised Me (In a Good Way):Works with HomeSeer and Sense. Yes, it actually integrates with your unnecessarily complicated smart home setup. Now your home automation scripts can finally control your lava lamp and judge your coffee maker’s electricity addiction.Shows individual power usage per outlet. Fantastic! Now I can see exactly how much energy my air fryer is consuming while it reheats a single chicken nugget. Spoiler alert: it's embarrassing.Wi-Fi connectivity actually works. After the obligatory 20-minute app dance and three failed attempts to ""connect to device,"" it stayed connected and hasn’t dropped off the network once — which is more than I can say for my $200 router.Stands up well. No, seriously. It stands. Upright. Like a champion. No flopping around like a sad fish behind your TV. It knows its purpose.Some Gently Sarcastic Notes:The app is... fine. It works. It's just not winning any UX design awards. But hey, once you've named each plug something inspiring like ""Lamp 1,"" ""Lamp 2,"" and ""Definitely Not a Lamp,"" you're golden.Don’t be fooled by how smart it is — it won’t do your taxes or explain crypto. It's still just a power strip. With ambition.The energy monitoring is cool until you realize your desk fan is basically a power-hungry gremlin. Knowledge is power... and now you can literally measure it.Final Thoughts:If you're the type who wants to know exactly how much electricity your fish tank filter is using at 3 AM — congratulations, this is your holy grail. Works well, plays nice with all the smart home toys (including HomeSeer and Sense), and looks like it came straight out of a sci-fi movie.Just don’t expect it to do anything actually intelligent, like stop you from buying more smart plugs.Read more"

I have 3 of these now and want more. I automated my room's lights, humidifier, air purifier, and all my reptile lamps. I absolutely recommend these for automating reptile setups, they are way better than manual reptile branded power strips. I also researched to make sure these power strips could handle multiple lights and heat lamps. They can. They also have good surge protection for things like your computer or tv.-The app is also super easy to use. I love being able to monitor power usage and easily turn a light on or off using my phone. I use the app's widgets on my samsung phone to add shortcuts to my home screen so I dont have to go into the app to quickly turn a light on or off. It's really easy to set schedules, timers, names, and organize it the way you like.-I've used other smart plugs before and they didn't work very well. They always had issues with disconnecting and the apps for other brand were annoying to use. For this power strips, I've rarely had connection issues.-I absolutely recommend this power strip to people with animal setups, people who want to automate their rooms, and people who want a reliable power strip that will protect their electronics.Thanks for coming to my Ted TalkRead more"

Way more convenient.It feels really well made. The materials are solid, and it doesn’t look or feel cheap at all. Setup was smooth. The Kasa app recognized it right away, and the interface is super easy to use. I like that you can control each outlet independently, which gives you a lot of flexibility depending on what you’ve got plugged in. Works great with Google AssistantAnother big plus for me is being able to monitor the power usage from each connected device.

Perfect for my needs, just what I was looking for!!","I realized its not easy to find an outdoor smart plug that has individual control of the outlets! What a headache that was, & lots of searching to find this! Luckily I did & its perfect! I do wish that the cord came in more options as far as length and also that it wasn't SO thick! But I made it work & am happy with my results. I needed to be able to turn on my outside string lights on my phone vs having to plug/unplug them everytime I went outside. Now I can control all that from my phone & even have it on a schedule which is even better!! (:I did think it said I could use them 'smart life' app & was a bit disappointed to see it only showed the 'kasa' app on the setup directions (another app to add to my smart home folder in my phone :/ lol). No big deal though, im just happy to of found this, that it has individual control of the outlets and that it seems to work great so far! Every/anything else i can work around. I also like that it has little covers for the plug(s) not in use. Bit flimsy & thin but still work & better than nothing I think considering its outside. Where I have mine- my porch rarely ever gets water that far back so im not worried about it getting wet or anything but I still just like the option & that the covers are there.I definitely recommend. So far its been great, its been about a week almost 2 now. Im very happy with it & it works as expected. Cord is pretty thick & short but aside from that, its great! & it seems to be slim pickings anyways as I mentioned above so considering that as well.. this thing is awesome! Very happy!

If pressed it will switch on or off all receptacles at the same time. Using the app you can set up individual schedules or timers for all receptacles and USB port cluster. The app also lets you create smart scenes to integrate it with other devices or trigger a switching event based on weather condition changes. I am planning to shut off all the devices just before the thunderstorm forecast. I had to replace the pre-amp and distribution amp when lightning struck the antenna. And even though everything was grounded the voltage surge in the TV cable killed both amps as they were powered up. This extension cord also has a convenient 45 degree plug. It can be placed on the floor or mounted on the wall. Each USB-A or USB-C slot can supply up to 30W of charging power with voltage going up to 12V.Read more"

The Power Strip is compatible with 2.4GHz Wi-Fi ONLY, offers surge protection, and you can turn your devices on or off by voice or through one of the many applications that you can run from your phone or PC, such as Alexa, Gosund, and Smart Things.  I also like that you can mount the device to a wall (see picture) or to the side of a desk, depending on what you have plugged into the power strip.Having the capability to turn on a set of devices made it very easy to control my home theater, so the right equipment turns on depending on the activity I am preparing to watch.  For example, if I am watching my FIOS Cable TV, then I power on my FIOS Cable Box, Onkyo AVR, Panasonic TV, and it turns off my Roku and Blu-ray DVD players.  By allowing you to only power on the equipment that you need to be able to watch the devices you need to use, the power strip is also saving you money and the life of your other equipment that can remain powered off.I have two minor suggestions for a future version of this power strip, but not having them does not subtract from the overall high rating that I have given to this product’s current design.The first suggestion would be to provide the capability to allow the user to be able to turn off a device, without turning off the associated power strip outlet for the device.  This functionality would be very useful.  For example, it would be nice to setup the time on my TV once, which will be preserved when the TV is no longer required to be on.  Currently, when I tell Alexa to turn off my Panasonic TV, the outlet is turned off and the time settings in the TV are lost.  I don’t know how hard it would be to implement this type of capability, but if you could do it easily, I would highly recommend you do it.The only other suggestion would be to offer the Power Strip in a metal enclosure.Read more"

I can't use this for my reptiles OR my plants like this. Honestly, I can't use it for anything. I'm going to contact the seller and see what they have to say about it. Very disheartened that it's buggy like this.I bought this and then didn't open it for a couple of months so I'm really glad it works so well. It's the only smart power strip with all plugs controlled individually and the ability to control the USB ports. However, the USB ports are controlled as one and that's the only let down. Would love to be able to control the USB ports separately and would really love to see an even larger smart strip to accommodate more plugs. I use these for reptile and plant setups and a couple more plugs would make it perfect. Still worthy of the 5 stars though.Read more"

I have to say that this power strip has been perfect for my needs and exactly what I had been looking for. Due to each plug having the ability to be scheduled independently, I can have my mini fans for air circulation connected to the Usb ports, the humidifier, and plant lights connected to the 3 prong outlets, and all connected to the same power strip while still being on their own individual schedules. This saves me from having to use multiple smart plugs for each component individually which is a great space saver as well as not having to deal with the stress of using multiple different apps or multiple plugs in different portions of an app.I have somewhat poor health which means that I become bed ridden more than I'd like to say. If it wasn't for the convenience of this power strip and it's partner app I most likely would have lost hundreds of plants a long time ago. I will definitely be purchasing this product again for any other greenhouses I may build in the future.Read more"

It's responsive, integrates well with smart home systems, and is easy to set up.

Since I’ve switched to Alta fiber 1Gb service with 4 Amazon Eeros mesh 6e units. The combination of eeros with fiber allows for a seamless operation with zero problems. The better your network, the stronger consistent symmetrical up/down use with no throttling back. I highly recommend the Geeni & Eeros products.

Homekit setup could not have been easier and I did not have to do any special tricks to get it to connect to my wifi. In Homekit you can keep the power strip listed at one device or break out the outlets and group of USB's so they appear as individual units.Overall built quality seems very good.  The meross app lets you see wifi signal strength along with the firmware version and option to turn the LED's on or off, which are great for use in a bedroom since they are pretty bright.

But the price was worth investigating for my needs in a work from home scenario where I wanted remote access (HomeKit) to turn on/off office lighting for video conferencing.There are some awkward translation in the manual, but nowhere near poor enough to have any misunderstanding about how to setup.  The manual tells you many times to reach out tot heir support team if you have any trouble - but setup was simple so I didn't need to do that.What can I say?  It was simple and straightforward to setup and it works well.  I knew in advance that my home mesh wifi network was dual band, and I knew from reading the manual that the best thing to ensure easy setup is to disable 5 GHz band during the setup period - so I didn't run into any issues there (I use Eero for my router so it was simple to temporarily disable the 5 GHz for this setup).In Homekit I was able to take the single tile for the power strip and flip a switch so that each outlet had it's own tile in my Homekit room.I'll report back after a month or two if there are any updates - but right now my thoughts are that this is a simple product that was simple to setup - at a good value.Read more"

I had never set any other wifi timer device up before but found this to be kind of easy once you get the hang of it. I also have Apple home kit so I set it up with that but it doesn't allow for programing intricate timers for on off use every hour so I used the Meross ap to set the scenes and it's flawless once you figure out how to do it.  I have a fan and mister that goes on and off different times of the day all day and night long and lights that go on and off once a day and night and it all works.  I watch some videos to learn how to set it up which helped. The only 2 things I don't like is that the 3 usb ports only have one setting  so you have to use 3 things with the same timing.

I purchased one a couple months ago, loved it, and so I bought two more just this past week.  I have the three of them set up to turn on/off four lights twice a day (three hours in the morning and 5+ hours in the evening) and also have them hooked up to Alexa with two commands.  They are fairly easy to setup initially via the app and also simple to pair with Alexa, just follow the instructions and you're golden.I'm not going to lie though, I did encounter a couple minor, super small hiccups during the setup but nothing that I couldn't figure out or would cause me to rate this any lower than a 5 star (maybe a 4.5 but since half stars aren't allowed we will round up).  First tiny hiccup: the first wemo I purchased took a few tries in getting the app to recognize it but with some persistence, a dash of patience, and a couple of restarts of the wemo, wemo app, and iPad and it was good to go in less than 15 minutes and it hasn't given me any trouble since (the two other wemos I purchased a week or so after and together they took less than 5 minutes to setup).  Second and last little hiccup (solved in less than 10 mins but still something for users to be aware of): getting Alexa to turn my two newest wemos on at the same time by saying one command, I thought I could be clever and name both wemos with the same name and Alexa would know to turn both on/off when I said their name, however, it turns out that you have to instead create a ""group"" within Alexa's app containing the wemos you want to turn on/off together and the caveat is they cannot have the same name within the wemo app.  If anyone figured out how to side step this (besides creating a group or asking Alexa more than one command) let me know, but naming two wemos the same name just did not work for me (or Alexa).Use one wemo for two lights! - My third wemo works double and controls our two small lights on either side of our tv, just plug a multi-socket plugin into the wemo plug and wah-la, a one plug wemo became a two plug wemo. :)Lastly, and most importantly, our cat Snickers is a HUGE FAN of these wemos and appreciates them very much because it makes her feel like we are home if we get home late or go away for the weekend. And yes, Snickers told me this herself, she also said that her and Alexa get along great and that they talk at least a few times a day. I have not witnessed any of their interaction because she says they only chat when we aren't home, and trust me I've tried asking Alexa if she talk with Snickers and she just outright denies knowing who Snickers is altogether.  I have also tried looking into Alexa's app for the conversations but to no avail, I suspect either Snickers is going onto my iPad and deleting their convos or Alexa is not recording them.  I contemplated getting a security camera but as much as I want proof of their friendship I would just never forgive myself if I ruined it.In any case, these are great and I definitely recommend purchasing more than one, at least enough to control all the lamps you turn on daily or even periodically because the wemo app also lets you set which days you want it to turn on/off.Read more"

The answer I got was yes and it was true (I think) what I wasn’t told was that in order to work with Homekit it was necessary to update the firmware. Not really a big deal but if you’re installing eight of them it does take some time. With that said, I did get all the devices to show up in the Homekit app (although one stubborn unit took a total restart to do so) and I can operate through both the Homekit and Wemo apps. I have not yet had the chance to work our automation on HomeKit nor the chance to blend them into Alexa (I’m trying to make this really easy for someone else) but my first impressions are -It’s a fairly simple setup once you get the first oneIt does what it should.Check back for an update on the grouping, voice automation (a single device at a time has worked as hoped) and finally voice control on two separate OS’s, HomeKit and Alexa. Probably a weekend adventure.An add on update. I set up two scenes through HomeKit (very simple to do btw)  and both worked with either the phone scene tab on the app and with Siri. With that said and as I have read elsewhere, three devices dropped from the network and had to be found again. For the mathematically inclined, that’s nearly a forty percent drop rate on the second day. I’ll attribute that for now to the new programming but am not encouraged that issues have showed up so quickly.Final edition- have had the plugs three weeks now. Working flawlessly and will buy a few more (running eight now) based on my experience. Please note that I have only run them with HomeKit but I would expect the same results from Alexa.Final final edition. I have added two more of these to my network to now total ten. My caveat remains that set up and integration into HomeKit can still be frustrating but....I didn’t need a hub and the HomeKit scenes I have set up have performed without fail. Just remember you need to update the firmware to make it work. Once brought into the HomeKit network, it works with my tv remote, my phone, my Mac laptop.....you get the picture. My wife loves coming home this time of year and turning on lights all around the house with only asking for it. Nice feature to have. You cannot dim lamps (yet?) but on and off based on the scene you define is all we really wanted. I’ve upgraded my rating to a five in spite of the sometimes setup failure.Read more"

The ""Timer"" feature is actually a stop watch type function that counts down.It's ""Schedule"" that allows you to set an ON time and then an OFF time for each smart outlet.One of my lava lamps wouldn't turn off when it was set to. I simply deleted that schedule and made a new one. It has been working just fine ever since.And I love being able to control the outlets from an app on my phone!

The device connected perfectly and worked for almost a month. On thanksgiving I was woken up, at 3:49am, to an awful sound and flashing lights. Apparently the surge protector, which I had all the outlets full but only 2 working, decided that it didn’t want to protect any surges. A mini electrical fire started and melted the housing of the plug for the Edison connector. It also melted the outlet I was using.Looking at the surge protector the cable was extremely hot to the touch and one of the terminals of the plugs were completely melted off.I do not recommend this item at all as during the entire debacle it did not shut itself off, the entire reason I go this was in case of power draw issues the entire thing would turn off by itself.This device had two jobs, to allow for me to turn the devices to be turned on/off and to turn itself off if any problems occurred. It didn’t do so. And actively caused a safety harm while I was sleeping.DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE!Read more"
Smart Plugs and Outlets,"Kasa Smart Plug Classic 15A, Smart Home Wi-Fi Outlet Works with Alexa & Google Home, No Hub Required, UL Certified, 2.4G WiFi Only, 1-Pack(HS105), White",8.,4.5,"13,599",https://us.amazon.com/dp/B01K1JVZOE,5.0,"April 1, 2017",5.0 out of 5 starsInstructional Review: Tiny and magnificent. You'll LOVE IT!!!,"After researching automated light switches and outlets to control my lights, I picked TP-Link because they do not require a separate hub to work. Out of the box, install or plug-in, load the Kasa app and create an account, discover using the Kasa app (connect the device to your WiFi at home) and you're ready to go.I absolutely LOVE the light switches and the outlet plugs. The online TP-LINK installation videos are awesome; short and concise with clear instructions.  These Smart devices work perfectly every time using the Kasa app, Alexa and now the Google Assistant. When the power went out once, the devices automatically reconnected and worked flawlessly. BEST PURCHASE EVER!!!I bought the Amazon Echo Dot - 4 times - and controlled my lights from anywhere in the house simply by speaking to Alexa.Then, as of 3/25/17, Google Assistant got in the action. So now I can also tell my phone ""Ok Goggle, turn on the Basement"" and the two Smart Plugs (one mini and one original-sized) turn on together since I made a ""basement"" group to include them both.If you're buying these Smart Plugs or Smart Switches for the first time, the below info will be helpful to know to avoid asking yourself ""why is it not working for me the way people say they do?""1. You need to install the Kasa app and create a user account to operate your devices using your phone/tablet. The Smart devices must be able to connect via the WiFi in your house to be operated remotely (by you not manually touching the device). Although you can still operate the devices manually, you bought these to operate them remotely. The Kasa app let's you name each Smart device (IMPORTANT: NAME EACH DEVICE AND GROUP AS YOU WANT TO CALL IT OUT USING ALEXA OR GOOGLE ASSISTANT) and create ""Scenes"" to group multiple Smart devices to turn on/off at the same time. Tapping on the device name in the Kasa app opens the options to set schedules, timers and more.2. Got an Amazon Echo? Install the Alexa app on your phone/tablet, add the Kasa Skill, link the Kasa Skill to your Kasa account (from point #1 above), discover devices, then create Groups - similar to the Scenes in Kasa - and select which devices to include in the group for Alexa to know what you meant to turn on/off at the same time. If you DON'T create groups in the Alexa Skill: A) Simply ask Alexa to turn on/off the individual Smart device name, and... B) Alexa will NOT know which multiple Smart devices to turn on/off at the same time - even though you created a Scene (group) in the Kasa app, key phrase here... ""in the Kasa app"".  After you create a group name and include Smart devices in the Alexa Skill, you'll feel like one of The Jetsons, a Star Trek crew member or a millionaire, with the power to command lights on and off using you voice: ""Alexa, turn on the Living Room"".3. Got an Android smartphone/tablet with Android version 6.0 or higher? Google began sending upgrades to those devices to install the Android Assistant - the same Artificial Intelligence (AI) used with the Google Home device (the device that competes with Amazon Echo).  Here's the deal, similar to the Alexa Skill, you NEED to enable and setup the Android Assistant using the similar steps I described in topic #2 above: Link it to your Kasa account, create Group names and add Smart devices to the group, etc.  To set up your Android Assistant to operate your TP-LINK Smart devices, start by saying ""Ok Google, turn on my LIGHTS"" - the AI is smart and will prompt you with a bubble for you to setup Google Home interfaces. It's da bomb!Hopefully this will help you enjoy your TP-LINK Smart devices as much as I do.If you're thinking ""I'm still not sure if I should get these or another brand...""  GET THESE!!! You will not regret it. They work great! Also, when I had questions, their customer support was very responsive. The love is definitely there.My goal is to get my entire house upgraded to use only TP-LINK light switches. In time, as the budget allows, it will happen.Read more"

Updating review to 5-stars!*** UPDATE 5-24-2017 ***Firmware 1.2.1 appears to have solved the problem of dropping wifi connection.  Prior to 1.2.1, the longest my HS105's would stay connected to wifi was 8 hours before they dropped/reconnected.  With 1.2.1, my HS105's have now been continually connected for over 96 hours.I am leaving my 3-star rating for now, because...  The KASA app doesn't detect/upgrade the new firmware.  To update to 1.2.1, you need a Windows PC and should search the web for ""tp-link faq-949"".  That will give you a page where you can download a firmware update utility.  The utility is very crude, and always says ""update failed!"" even though it successfully updates the HS105.If tp-link gets the KASA app fixed so that it can update HS105 to 1.2.1, or starts shipping with 1.2.1 installed, I will bring this rating up to 5 stars.*** ORIGINAL REVIEW ***I had a hard time deciding how to rate this...Functionally, it has worked perfectly -- I am using it with both the iOS app and Alexa, and it has never failed to operate as it should, turning on/off as commanded.  So from a purely functional standpoint, in my particular environment, it rates 5 stars.But there is ""something wrong"" with the device firmware; it randomly drops and reconnects from wifi.  At least with my particular router, this doesn't present a problem, and in fact the only way I know it is disconnecting/reconnecting is by looking at the router statistics. The connection may last for an hour, two hours, even eight hours -- then it disconnects.  With my router, it reconnects and continues just fine -- but from a lot of the bad reviews here, I suspect the reconnect doesn't work with all routers.  Signal strength is excellent, so it isn't a signal problem.In fact, I have a tp-link HS200 (wall switch), and it stays connected indefinitely.  This is in the same location, with the same signal strength.  The HS200 stays connected forever, but the HS105's (I have three of them) all disconnect/reconnect randomly after 0-8 hours of operation.I have updated the HS105 to the latest firmware, 1.1.3, but this makes no difference.So from a functional standpoint, with my router (Asus AC88U), I'd give this 4-5 stars. Easy to set up, works well with the TP-Link iOS app and with Alexa.  But there is something wrong....  And depending on your router, the frequent disconnect/reconnect may be invisible to you (as it is to me), or it may require manual intervention.Hopefully this is something TP-Link will fix with a future firmware release.Read more"

Don't like the bulk of traditional timers?  Well look no further than this smart mini plug.

I primarily use these for light decorations inside and outside of the house.  I have them all set to go on at the same times and off at the same times.  They have performed flawlessly and the app makes it a breeze to setup.  They don't take up much space at all and you can still use the second outlet in your wall plug.  These are designed well and if you need to use both receptacles, they plug in without issues.You can also use these for your existing floor lamps, table lamps, etc.  Almost anything you want to put a timer on, this product will do it.  You don't need to use the timer if you don't want to so if you want to keep your lights off until you are ready to head home you can remotely turn on your lights.  I have also used this to control my crock pot.  I use it to delay turn on and auto shut off my crock pot at certain times depending on recipe.I also have the Tp-link smart switches and a dimmer.  Good eco-system and the app is always updating.  These plugs are just a good addition to the ecosystem of smart switches.  I would definitely recommend these without hesitation.Read more"

In the past I was not able to find good motion, humidity and temperature sensors for the Google Home side of things. I think this Tapo line is fairly new and i only noticed it recently, however, the Tapo line appears to fill in some holes that existed in their lineup.Important note, this device does require a Tapo hub, sold separately.I have a bunch of quite old Kasa bulbs and switches that were integrated in the old Kasa app. I was worried that this new Tapo app would not talk to the legacy Kasa app but that worry was unfounded. The Kasa app and the Tapo app linked to each other seamlessly. I can see all my legacy devices now in the Tapo app and it brought over all my automations. Connecting the motion sensor to the Tapo app was straightforward.Important exception, the Tapo app doesn't have geo-fencing yet. So be aware if that's a major selling point for you it isn't enabled in Tapo, yet.The motion sensor works pretty much the way you would expect. It's quite sensitive, I can activate it just by waving my hand at it from 10 feet away. It also comes with a stick on pad and a nifty ball and socket connection that lets you aim it just the way you need. It's a nicely implemented little motion sensor. On a side note, I used to have all kinds of issues with my smart devices and recently I specifically created, on my router, a separate AP that only uses 2.4ghz. Then when I connect devices that require 2.4ghz I use that AP (I named it router2.4 to make it easy to identify). I recommend that and most routers support doing it.Read more"

I set the hub to alarm when the door is opened but you can customize when or if you want alarm to sound when your door or window is opened. I agree with the other reviews. The alarm on the hub isn't very loud. I'm using it on my attic door and the hub is plugged into my bedroom a few feet away. I'm planning on getting a sensor for my front door so not sure if I'll here the alarm on the downstairs hub very good from my bedroom.

I am so pleased with this convenience and no longer worry about packages.I have set this up in TWO houses in difference states, with different internet providers/equipment and totally different experiences.In the first house, it was very easy to set this up. I followed the instructions in the box to initially get started. It comes with two parts:  a “hub” which is the brain of the thing that plugs in to an electrical outlet, and a sensor that sticks to the back of your garage door with provided Velcro sticky mounts.First you install the MyQ app on your phone, and the app provides you with step-by-step instructions.  It’s really easy.  It also asks if you want to “show me”(watch a short video for certain steps).  You can skip the short videos if you want to, but I found them to be very helpful.  The major steps are:(1) sync the hub to your phone(2) connect the hub to your wi-fi(3) stick the sensor onto the back of your garage door(4) test the connection between the garage door sensor and the hub and test that it opens the door.After everything tests out okay, they tell you how to mount the hub in a permanent place.  It needs to be plugged into an outlet in your garage, within 50 feet of your wi-fi source (your router), and at least 6 feet off the floor.  I mounted mine to the ceiling in the garage, plugged it into the same outlet where the garage door opener is plugged in.The whole setup was very easy.  So far, Amazon has delivered 4 packages inside my garage—out of the rain and away from passers by.  I do not usually have a need to open my garage door remotely, so I pretty much use this just for Amazon Key deliveries.  But, have you ever left home and then wondered if you remembered to close the garage door?  This gizmo will let you know if your door is open or shut.  Relief.Some people complained that the MyQ app is not integrated with other apps like SmartThings.  I don’t really care about that.  This device cost $30, and it came with a coupon to get $30 off my first Amazon Key delivery (limit of one).  I have two individual garage doors, and purchased a second sensor for the second door.  The first garage door setup was basically free. How can you beat that??I had such a good experience with house 1, that I decided to do the same set up in our vaation home, in a different state.  TOTALLY OPPOSITE EXPERIENCE  tried literally everything, but the Hub would not connect.I finally concluded that my brand of router/modem in the vacation home was not compatible.  I spent many hours researching this on the internet and also on the phone with both MyQ and Chamberlain both.  They were both very helpful, but NO LUCK it just would not work.  The router we were using was TP Link AC1900 Archer 8, and the modem was Netgear CM600.  One or the both of them just did not work with this MyQ devise.TWO YEARS later, we changed internet providers to Century Link--they provide their own router/modem so I am not longer using the TP Link/Netgear equipment.  I decided to try the MyQ hub again and it was VERY EASY to connect with no issues with Century Link's Quantum Fiber equipment.  We have two separate garage doors with two separate openers.  I was able to connect both garage openers to the same hub, and order an extra sensor for the second garage door.  I am VERY HAPPY to be able to use Amazon Key service in our vacation home now.I don't know why, but it currently costs the SAME regardless of whether you purchase a complete HUB WITH the sensor OR a second sensor alone.  Even though I could use the original HUB for the second garage door, I ordered the complete hub/sensor set and am using only the sensor for the second garage door.  I figure that I have a ""free"" backup HUB in case I have a problem with it later.I write honest reviews to help others make informed purchases. I do that because I read reviews myself and appreciate how helpful they can be.  I hope my review helped you.Read more"

Not compatible with anything else.,"I was reading reviews of door opener apps and there were many good reviews of this adapter. In fact, they suggestd getting a MyQ enabled opener. I priced that option. It was $900+. Instead I spent $25 on this adapter because I have very good liftmaster openers on both of garager doors.Installation was very easy. You have to use the app. If you don't want to use an app, don't get a MyQ device because the only benefit of MyQ is app compatability. The app walks you through the installation. There were no problems other than our garage has one outlet and it is inconvenient. So, I ran an extension cord to it. After install, the app and device work seamlessly. I was able to get everyone invited. For ease there, we used our existing gmail accounts to sign into the app. Then, logging in doesn't require an extra step because we are already logged into our phones.After install and use, I tested it out. It is slow to close the door because it beeps for a while and then closes the door. Openining is immediate. I had no issues with the network becasue the router is on the opposite side of the wall from the main MyQ hub. If anything, it is too close.After that, I looked into connecting it to Android Auto. It turns out that all of the articles I read are old. MyQ doesn't work with Google Home, Google Assistant, or Android Auto. I couldn't even find a way to open it from the car's interface. It is an independent app. To use it, you have to open the MyQ app on your phone (because there no way to get to it otherwise) and use it. My idea of having a garage door button in Android Auto will have to wait to see if Chamerlain and Google ever decide to play nice with one another.Read more"

I have tried three of these motion sensors and the batteries died between 1 and 3 weeks on each of the sensors.  Up until the batteries died the motion sensor worked great.  Other reviewers have reported similar experiences and I can confirm they are correct if the sensor is used in a room where there are people to detect.  If you install it inside a closet where the only motion detected is when the closet door is opened, the batteries will probably last longer. This sensor uses two 2450 lithium batteries that cost about $3 each so plan on that recurring cost if you want to use this sensor.  But even if you are OK with the $6 battery cost, replacing the batteries is not easy and there is a good chance you may break the sensor trying to remove the batteries.  This is because a a long battery holder cylinder has to be pried out to get to the batteries.  These two issues make this sensor a bad choice.  I have not experienced this with any of the other Aquara Zigbee sensors that I use so this one seems to be a bit of a bad Unicorn.Read more"

I feel it cold be smaller, but adding in the AAA battery compartment, it makes a bit of sense that it's notThe bad:- Requires an app. Not necessarily obtained through third-party sites. I actually got the app first before the device.- Adding the device to the app is a bit painful. You'll likely need to do it twice (to familiarize yourself with the process the first time) unless your phone is setup to grant absolutely all permissions to everything immediately- Alerts work, but by default, it's the most obnoxious and urgent-sounding alarm... for a door being opened/closed/low battery. NOTE: This uses ""alert notifications"" not ""notifications"", so on glorious Android, this can be altered to your liking pretty easily so that you have a distinct, calmer, alert notification sound for this app- There's a flashing light. I understand that it needs to have some level of direct communication, and it's small enough to cover with tape or something, but still. When I get things that start beeping and flashing, my first goal is to prevent them from beeping or flashingThe Ugly:- The app refuses to work unless you grant location permissions - PRECISE location permissions. This is apparently a one-time thing, as after setup, you can remove the permission. The app cries about it, but will continue to work.- You cannot connect this bluetooth/wifi device with only bluetooth. You need to give it (via the app) your wifi password.- Many features you'd expect, like alternate notifications outside the app cost additional money on a subscription basis. I'm fine with just the app notifications, personally.

I have been waiting a while for a company to make an outside motion sensor that works with Alexa.  At the beginning of 2021, I did suggest this to Yolinks in their feedback section.  Yolink seems to be very open to feedback.What I like/PROS ​about this motion sensior.1) How small it is compared to other outside motion sensors on the market.  Much easier to place in location where it is not as noticeable.2) Like all Yolink devices, this device is extremely easy to setup. In the app, tap the scan icon, scan the QR, tap bind, your done.3) The Yolink app is extremely user-friendly.  The designers and programmers must actually be using the app and Yolink devices.  In the app, it is very easy to rename the Yolink device to what is convenient and/or useful to you.  Device settings are easily changed, tap the device icon, then select setting.  No hunting and digging around in four or five deep menus, trying to find something that is hidden under some obscure label/name.4) Another very nice thing that the Yolink app and Alexa skill does is, any new Yolink device scanned is automaticall added to Alexa's device list. No need to have Alexa scan for new devices before you can start setting up routines in Alexa.5) Another great feature is that when a sensor sends a notice to your phone, it also includes the battery status.  No more guessing if batteries are low. You can also see this within the app by selecting the device, then settings where you can see the battery level.6) This is more about the Yolink hub that the sensors connect to.  If the sensors are controlling other Yolink devices such as wall switches, electrical plugs/outlets or even setting off the Yolink alarm siren, It does NOT need internet connectivity. Yolink devices communicate to each other via the Yolink hub. This interaction is almost instant.  Internet access is needed to communicate with Alexa and other none Yolink devices an to be able to sent notifications to your phone.At this time, I cannot rate the battery life. Only been using the outside motion sensors for four days (as of 05/31/21). If they are like the other Yolink devices, the battery life should be very good.Currently I have one of these sensor for my driveway. If it detects motion, I get notified on my phone and I have a routine in Alexa setup to make an announcement on all echo speakers.  Love this feature. I also setup one for my side door, doing similar things. If you have kids playing in the yard, you might want to set times when different sensors are active and when they are not.At night, I am testing how good these sensor and the Alexa Yolink skill is at turning on different exterior lights, when motion is detected.The only concerned I have, it is not really a CON at this time.1) The small mounting bracket, will it hold up to Florida weather?  Only time will tell.  At this time, I cannot reduce the rating because I do not know how strong the mounting bracket is.This maybe a CON for some, not for me.1) The mounting bracket only has vertical movement/adjustment, no horizontal adjustment at all.  Not an issue for me, but might be for some.These motion sensors are replacing existing sensor around my home.  The driveway sensor, a weather/rain hood is already installed and pointing in the correct direction.  The other one, like other outdoor sensors I have, are mounted under the house/roof eaves for some protection, on mounts I have already designed and pointed in the desired direction.So far, these new Yolink outdoor motion sensors are working out much better than I expected.  I have two more on order (05/30/21) for my front and back doors.  Only time will tell if they will holdup to normal Florida weather.I will update if my option changes.Read more"

So why buy yolink?If you are thinking of this question then stop thinking and buy first and the read my review. I have been experimenting with smart home products since last 7 years when they were barely launched starting with smart bulbs and moving on to all different products and using Alexa to bind them and then comes these sensors.Frankly I have wasted tons of money on contact and motion sensors. I have tried sensors linked to hubs via zigbee and zwave which have their own problems with regards to range and going offline etc etcThen comes wifi sensors which require routers in every room and they have a significant lag ofcourse. And if your wifi is down then bye bye to themFrankly I was so fed up I stopped using any sensors. Controlled everything with voice which works atleast 99% of timeAnd then I read about yolink. Their loran technology. I am from aviation and yes we have knowledge of long range technology and different wavelengths as such. So we'll it seemed interesting.But I had wasted enough money and now I cannot trust anyone unless I try my hands on. For a change just ordered 2 motion sensors and one hub just to experiment knowing I will lose my money againI stay in part of world where we use brick and concrete walls where even drill machines give up, forget any sensors. And when nothing works it's YOLINK which works.And they were flawless. I did a stress test. Kept their hub in living room and I installed motion sensors in bathroom which are inside my bedroom. There are like quite a few walls and doors between hub and sensors.And oh my god they just work instant. Like super instant. They are truly truly SUPER LONG RANGESo they can pass through walls concrete bricks doors and what all and still respond instantBest thing each set up literally takes 20 secs flat. I bet not more than 20 secs ever. I was so happy I order so many more sensors.As of now I have 12 window door sensors, 5 motion sensors, key fob and their speaker hub. To set all these sensors over all it took me like less than 5 mins. Such straight forward pairing and app is straightforward.Also do register for their newsletter as I ended up getting 20% coupons which saved quite an amount.Overall I feel nothing can beat these sensors ever in terms of simplicity reliability and range which is my fav as its superrrr looong range. Hats off for such wonderful products and technology.Read more"

The configuration is easy in the app, but it does take some time as you have to input and limit it's effective range of sensing movement and presence. Thankfully the app screen is easy to read and interpret during the configuration process. I have it so the lights can change color at specific times of the day depending on the presence in a room. Some things to be mindful of: it has to remain plugged in; it seems to only command Govee products ( I use google home and it just says if someone is present or not); it will take a few seconds to register that a person is in a room so it isn't as fast as a dedicated PIR sensor.Hover makes good stuff - especially their lights - so I'd light to get more to make my house even smarter.

Smart Detectors,"THIRDREALITY Zigbee Motion Sensor 4 Pack, Zigbee Hub Required, Pet Friendly, Work with Home Assistant, SmartThings, Aeotec, Homey, Hubitat or Echo Devices with Built-in Zigbee hub",75.,4.0,"1,617",https://us.amazon.com/dp/B09MVTB4YH,5.0,"December 12, 2023",5.0 out of 5 starsGREAT NO-FRILLS SENSOR-  35 second recovery time!,"UPDATED BELOWI picked this up for $15.99 and so far so good.  The sensor is about as small as it could possibly be and still fit two AAA batteries inside.  It paired right away via Zigbee with my Hubitat C-5 hub and no other configuration was required (but see the little quirk below in the update).  It does not have a tamper sensor.  The only data returned by the sensor are motion and battery level.  The coverage area is nice and wide and I was pleased to discover that the motion sensing recovery time is only about 35 seconds.  Why does this matter?I currently have six Bosch motion/temp sensors in various places and one of them is right outside my front door.  I happened to get those on some sort of weird flash sale for $30 each where they were normally about $90.  For $30 they are just fine, but they are large, take 4AA batteries, and most significantly have a MINIMUM three-minute recovery time in between motion sensing events.I use one of the Bosch sensors to alert me when one of my two dogs has returned from whatever adventures they were having outside.  They tend to do their own thing and one of them almost always comes back before the other one.  If they return more than three minutes apart then it's not problem and I get two separate alerts for the two different dogs and can open the door twice.  But if the second dog comes back during the three-minute window right after the first, the Bosch motion sensor won't pick up the new motion alert and the second dog will be forced to wait outside with no recognition from his owner.No big deal right?  He just has to wait another three minutes.  Well, no.  If you are within the three-minute recovery period and the sensor is tripped again, it starts a NEW three-minute recovery period.  Assuming the dog doesn't freeze to death and keeps moving at some point during that three-minute period, the sensor will just keep re-tripping and going into an endless loop of three-minute recovery periods until the dog finally freezes or dehydrates.  Thus the dilemma.With the 35-second recovery period of this sensor, I have now reduced the potential mortality rate of my second dog to return home by a factor of five.  Good progress.UPDATE:  The first sensor continues to work great a month later.  I bought two more via the two-pack deal.  The first one paired up instantly with zero issues.  The second one paired up fine but came up as (blank) for the device type (Hubitat C-5 hub) and very strangely showed ""Signify NV"" as the manufacturer instead of ThirdReality.  I tried changing the device type manually to ""Generic Zigbee motion sensor- no temp,"" which is what the other two sensors automatically configured as.  The sensor would show up as a device in my Hubitat device list but would not report any data.  I removed it, did a factory reset, re-added, repeated, and still had the same problem.  Posted a question here to see if there was a firmware update.Before I gave up, I tried one last thing that I had zero expectation of working.  I removed the device again from Hubitat, held down the reset button and did a factory reset, and then took the batteries out.  While holding down the reset button, I put the batteries back in and did one more reset.  I have no idea why or how, but this somehow fixed the issue.  The sensor paired up no problem with Hubitat, configured as ""Generic Zigbee motion sensor- no temp"" and properly showed ""ThirdReality"" as the manufacturer.  From there on out the sensor worked just fine.  I can't explain it but if you have the same weird problem I did, try doing a couple factory resets and holding down the button while taking the batteries out and then putting them back in.  LOL the mysteries of the universe.Read more"

Frustrating garbage.,Complete garbage. Got 1 of 2 connected pretty quickly and everything was looking good.  But after about 48 hours everything went south. One became unreachable.  So I reconnected it but regardless both stopped working on my zigbee network.  So hours and hours of trying to disconnect and reconnect I just gave up and will now buy another brand.  Such promise but these are cheaply made and my guess is they couldn't handle 50 degree F garage temps.  So maybe this would work better inside a heated space. Just guessing as I could no longer handle the frustration.Update:I'm new at zigbee.  I didn't realize these motion sensors are end points and not repeaters.  I spend another $100 on some 3 way switches and installed them in between my controller and the sensors.  Now one is green and one yellow but everything is working well now and I'm happy.  It's important to realize these are not nearly as powerful as wifi.  So you will need mains powered repeaters like switches in between.  I've been feeling out big time and have now spent $250 just to get my garage lights to turn on and start on with motion.  But it's sort of a hobby now and I've found more cool use cases like using an outdoor motion sensor to use an outdoor camera to snap a picture of my driveway and front door and text it email it and send me a telegram.  My wife can get it too but she doesn't care about it as much as I do.  I like to have evidence of my deliveries etc.  I had to use grok extensively to figure out how to get it to work.So I'm a happy camper but you best be ready to make this a full time job for a week or two.I also now have a water sensor next to my water heater that will beep and text me an alert if it defects water.

I contacted Eve product support and they immediately told me this issue is a known problem and told me how to fix it.  After the fix, the sensor has been working great since then.  So, I would advise people to contact Eve if their sensor is not working correctly.Also the sensor detects my presence at a distance of about 15 feet with the sensitivity setting set to Medium.Very good product and good product support.

I set it up, and it does detect motion.  I used it with Homekit and it connects with it after a couple of tries. I wanted to use it to turn the lights on when I enter a room and off when I leave.The bad: It doesn't continually detect whether you're in the room, so it's not good for what I wanted. it turns the lights on, but it was too difficult for me at least to get it to keep them on until I leave.  The best I could do is have it turn on, wait 10 minutes, then turn them off, if it didn't detect me. but it does not detect me if I'm sitting still. So it turns the lights off and then when I move again, it turns them back on, which is annoying. The solution to this is to get a presence sensor, not a motion detector and Aqara sells a presence detector, which I hope will work a lot better.Also bad: I changed the name of the Wi-Fi in our home and had to reprogram this to use the new Wi-Fi and it failed totally. I couldn't get it to work anymore so even though it had good reviews, I definitely would not buy it again.Edit: after several tries, and resets, I got it to pair again, but it failed almost immediately.

We had someone go up onto our porch and steal a cheap wooden bench in the middle of the night so bought this to create a routine that if motion is detected on the porch it will turn on the lights in two different rooms, turn up the volume on one of our home speakers and trigger a 30 second doorbell and barking dog audio file to trigger our dogs to start barking.  Then when motion is no longer detected it will turn off the lights.  This was super simple to do in the google home app by following the setup to connect it to Google Home.The one thing I believe most people miss is that when setting up you have to ensure the network you are on is 2.4ghz.  I did make the initial mistake of forgetting this and the unit would not work.  Realizing this, I simply removed it from google home, connected to our 2.4ghz bandwidth and then reset up and once that was done everything was simple to set up and then create a routine for it as mentioned above.  One thing that would help users is if they could show what wifi network the unit is connected to in Google Home.  I cannot speak to the SmartThings app as I did not want another app install.The detection is pretty good, range was a bit too long for us to point it toward the street as it would trigger when cars passed by about 30-35 feet away, so had to point it toward the house.  The cone of detection seems to be about 160-170ish degrees so works for our purpose and we don't get false alarms now from cars or people walking on the street.Overall, this works quite well as intended was super easy to set up.  Once realized the 2.4ghz was required, it too a total of about 15-20 mins to connect to Google Home and have routines set up.  It does require a hub to connect to, so keep that in mind also if you do not have a Google, SmartThings or other compatible hub already.Read more"

I bought the FP2 Detector because, unlike my first unit, it supports multiple detection zones. Being able to designate detection zones works much better for me. I am glad I made this purchase.The FP2 actually has three modes of operation – Fall Detection, Sleep Monitoring, and Zone Detection. I only use Zone Detection, and have set up 6 out of a maximum of 30 detection zones. The unit’s coverage area is divided into 320 checkerboard squares, and you can configure which of those squares compose each zone that you wish to create.My house has an open concept floor plan, and I have located my FP2 such that it can detect presence in my Kitchen, Dining Room, and Living Room. I have setup zones for controlling the ceiling lights in each of those these rooms, along with several individual lamps in various locations.The competitor’s Presence Detector I purchased earlier detected anything and everything within a 120° angle in front of it that was within a certain distance based on a ballpark sensitivity setting. It failed to detect some areas I wanted included, and detected other areas I didn’t wanted included. The FP2, with its zone detection, resolves that issue. For example, I have a small 2 square zone that encompasses our piano bench, which I use to turn ON the piano music light when and only when someone is sitting there.I noticed this product has some poor reviews. I suspect this is because some users had difficulty getting it setup and configured. I personally was a bit challenged getting mine setup and working, despite already having done lots of automations using dozens of smart devices. For this reason I have deducted one star. However, now that I am familiar with this unit and its capabilities, I would not hesitate to order another one – and I would not consider an alternate cheaper unit as I did for my first presence sensor.The instructions are sparse. I ended up setting it up three times before I got it working like I wanted. I discovered it helps to configure the Edge Zones along the perimeter of the detection area, as well as Entrance & Exit Areas to minimize unwanted detections. I also discovered it helps to be slightly generous on most Detection Zones because the exact location a person is in becomes less precise the further you are located from the sensor, or when a person is near a reflective surface such as a refrigerator.The Aqara App only controls Aqara devices. Thus, out of the box I couldn’t use it to perform any automation! Fortunately, it links to Alexa, and once I linked Aqara to Amazon’s Alexa, I could start controlling the lights and lamps in my house. The Aqara App claims to also link to Home Assistant, Google Home, and IFTTT. I don’t use IFTTT and was unable to get it to link to Home Assistant. For my more complex automations, I use Smartthings since Alexa routines are limited to a single Trigger. Thus, I ended up creating Virtual Switches in Smartthings and used Alexa to flip those switches based on Presence in each of the zones I created. Later, I got a Smartthings Hub which would recognize the FP2, which allowed me to use Smartthings without going through the overhead of Alexa.  Smartthings and its ability to use virtual switches allowed me to create more complex routines, such as turning off the lamp between my recliner and couch when some leaves the couch zone and no one is in the recliner zone – but if someone is still using the recliner, only turn Off the far couch lamp (multiple ‘IF’ triggers required).The FP2 has a Luminance meter, but getting that to control whether automated lights are turned On or not when Presence is detected was a big challenge for me. The workaround I initially came up with was to create a dummy zone in Aqara and use Aqara automation to control Home & Away status in that zone based on the Lux level. I then used an Alexa routine that would flip a Smartthings virtual switch based on the Aqara ‘Simple Security System’ device value of Home or Away. Why that functionality couldn’t have been made much more straight forward is beyond me. However, after I got my Smartthings Hub to recognize the FP2, I was able to add conditional triggers in my Smartthings automations that were tied to luminance levels, making FP2 luminance levels easier to include in automations and also make Lux thresholds flexible.The bottom line is that the FP2 is a very capable device. But more capabilities equates to more complexity. Thus, don’t expect to have lots of automation configured and working an hour after unpacking the unit. And unless you have other Aqara devices or a hub that recognizes the FP2, don’t expect to perform to automations until you link it to another App such as Alexa. Note that once you link Aqara to Alexa, you can pretty much do any automation that you would normally do in Alexa. It’s only when your automations get too complex for Alexa that automation understandably becomes a bit more involved, and has to jump through hoops involving products/apps from multiple manufacturers.Read more"

Someone should be fired,"Tldr: not that you have a choice since this is backordered, but don't buy this yet.Update 2:  after the new firmware update I was excited to see what would happen.  It's garbage.  Plain and simple.  They made the tracking distance 1 meter, which means when someone is walking next to you they steal the tracking.  This thing is useless if you live with anyone....including plants, pets, people, TV's, fans, shiny countertops, tile, windows, or doors that open and close.  All cause horrible interference, and you cannot simply mark out those places on the map.  Aqara is already removing promised features from their website.  Don't buy from companies that push products before they are even close to ready...it's embarrassing.Update as this might save someone days of their life: it might work in the future but currently if you tilt this device at all the results aren't good.  My best results are 6 feet off the ground and completely horizontal.  If you have one of these play with the placement as much as you can before you automate around it.  Some places worked initially but degraded over a few days.  Increased one star now that I have found a good placement.  Will update more as errors get resolved with ota.I've played with the fp2 for 4 days now almost continuously.  It's not ready, not even close.The app is horrible.  It is slow and locks up all of the time.  It's not only not updating my location in the app, sometimes if it is detecting me at all I just fall off of the radar standing 6 feet in front of it.  I check in home assistant and I'm not in the zone I'm standing in.  Clear view of sight, 6 feet away.  This isn't ok.Setting up the devices was also a nightmare.  I'm on an Samsung phone (s23) so maybe that had something to do with it but it took over 3 hours to set up both devices (the first time).  Constant errors, even though everything was correct. The solution was the just keep trying...tried about 20 times in a row.  Also, Bluetooth isnt showing up as a binding option 99% of the time, which is a shame because it works instantly when it comes up.Which brings me to another point...if you remove this device from home assistant, it never resends the homekit info.  You have to remove the device from aqara and the readd it.  Again...another headache getting everything reconnected.I bought these for the zone detection, which works great when it works and is abysmal other times.  I could have achieved my goals quite well with cheaper sensors but the posture detection was an added benefit that I was looking forward to. If aqara launched it like this I don't have much hope.And that brings me to the most frustrating part of this...it was working flawlessly 2 days ago and not skipping a beat.  And over the course of two days it started putting me in the wrong locations and only detecting me randomly.  At the time of writing this it isn't detecting anything at all and there are 3 of us and a large dog in the room.  No the sensor hasn't moved.  Hasn't drifted or anything like that.  Nothing has changed.There are so many other things that I've found that should have never made it past production.  Most of this is bad programming.  No clue if the hardware is to blame.Read more"

Meets and exceeds my expectations.Aqara have produced one hell of a sensor.The Lux sensor alone, is the fastest I’ve ever used. And that alone would be enough reason for me to buy more.I have two of the original FP1 sensors, which I’m currently using and both have been faultless. Once setup properly.But have been slow to detect presence. So still need a additional sensor to speed up motion detection and detect Lux levels.Absolutely not the case with the FP2’s presence sensing and its ability to zone a room.The down sides. The WiFi 2.4ghz only. Which makes it tricky to initially setup if your mesh router can’t split the networks.So if your a sole android user. This could cause a problem.As a IOS user and HomeKit user I had no such problem.But the Aqare iOS app when used with this sensor is extremely slow to display the current position of presence.Which gives the end user the belief that it’s not working as expected.But when you switch over to the android app. Positioning updates of presence update in real time. So obviously a bug with the IOS app.Home assistant. HomeKit integration works perfectly.I was aware that the sensor doesn’t currently work with GH and can’t be exposed to GH via home assistant. But that’s easy to get around with a few helpers and exposing the helpers to GH if needed.I will absolutely be buying more when availableRead more"

La configuration est simple et les zones de détection définies dans l’application Aqara fonctionnent de manière fluide pour détecter l’occupation. Le capteur est très précis, et il s’intègre parfaitement dans des projets domotiques avancés.Cependant, il y a quelques points à améliorer. Par exemple, il n’est pas possible de récupérer le nombre exact de personnes occupant une zone, ce qui pourrait être une fonctionnalité utile pour optimiser les automatisations basées sur la présence multiple.En outre, il est important de noter que ce capteur nécessite une alimentation continue, ce qui peut parfois rendre son intégration plus complexe si l’on souhaite éviter les câbles apparents. C’est un point à prendre en considération lors de l’installation, notamment dans les espaces où l’esthétique est importante.Aussi, les différents modes de détection (détection classique, détection de chute, et analyse sommeil) ne sont pas combinables et fonctionnent séparément. Bien que chaque mode soit efficace dans son propre contexte, pouvoir les utiliser simultanément serait un réel avantage.Malgré ces quelques limitations, c’est un excellent produit pour ceux qui recherchent une solution avancée de détection de présence et d’occupation.

What an absolute waste of money. Both sensors in the 2-pack had significant issues right from the start.Setting them up was frustratingly difficult - the app repeatedly failed to recognize the devices despite following the instructions exactly. After multiple attempts and nearly an hour of troubleshooting, I finally got them connected, only to experience constant disconnections.When they actually stayed connected (which was rare), the motion detection was wildly inconsistent. One sensor would trigger false alarms from things like shadows or air movement from the HVAC system, while the other would completely miss obvious movement right in front of it. The sensitivity settings in the app made virtually no difference to performance.Battery life was abysmal - despite claims of ""long-lasting performance,"" both units needed new batteries within just 10 days. The notification delays were also unacceptable for a security product, sometimes arriving minutes after motion was detected, rendering them useless for actual security purposes.The Alexa integration barely worked at all. Voice commands were rarely recognized, and when they were, the system would frequently respond with error messages or simply do nothing.The build quality feels cheap and flimsy, with battery compartments that are difficult to open and mounting hardware that seems likely to break with regular use.Save your money and invest in motion sensors from a reputable security company.

But it wasn’t smart. I wanted something that would not only alert me via a speaker, I also wanted on alerts on devices I always carry with me like my smartphone or Apple Watch.Fortunately this device fits the bill. If you want a driveway alarm that is reliable and is also smart, you should purchase this.PROS- Get alerts from the speaker hub, email, smart phone app notifications and sms.- easy to set up. It took more time to screw the thing to a tree then to actually pair it to the app.- Water and weather Resistant. There is a nice rubber seal on the inside to prevent water from getting in.- Works from far away. I have mine at the end of my driveway which is about 100-200 feet away and the signal is strong.- Very little delay from when a car or person passes through the sensor to the alert that is sent to the speaker hub and your smart phone.- The app is very flexible in terms of set up and the type of alerts you can get.- You can have the speaker hub say exactly what you type or upload your own Audio.CONS- I feel like I’ve had a few false alerts. But it may be because it’s an animal running by that triggers it which I can’t see.- Speaking of can’t see, I wish this had a camera attached to it. It would be a killer combo.I’ve been using a lot of the YoLink products because they are so easy to set up and work really well.

I just finished installing YoLink smart light switch, two motion sensors, two garage door sensors, and a garage door controller. Set up some direct automation too...so much FASTER and RELIABLE than IFTTT !!  I read a lot of reviews about ease of installation of YoLink products and it is true. But I wonder if many people really understand just how much easier it is.  The YoLink hub acts like a router in many ways (rapidly scanning all YoLink devices)....it dawned on me that to have installed 6 Wi-Fi devices in my home (without YoLink) would have required 6 manual ip assignments, setting up 12 Mac filters on my router and two access points to force devices to stay on strongest signal, saving new router and access point configurations, and working the router to get around limits on manually assigned IPs. This would have taken me most of the day. I installed YoLink devices in 2 hrs. without doing any of that nonvalue add crap above. Only one IP address is needed (for the wired hub).I installed the hub in my garage and connected it to a LAN port on the access point. From there it easily reaches mailbox sensors, motion detectors, door sensors etc. (see picture). Never have to worry about hub dropping WiFi connection because it is cable connected, and it is fast. The long range  LoRa technology is much more robust than Wi-Fi connections and could easily eliminate the need for access pointsPhone app is friendly and very intuitive.

Also, exposed to various platforms is the light/illuminance sensor.All in all, it functions exactly as you would expect for a motion sensor to work. If there is motion, it gets triggered. Light levels only update as motion is triggered, not a constant update; I would imagine otherwise battery brain would be obscene.(Important to note is: You do need to have a functional thread network set up for this device to work, as that’s the communication protocol of the device)Visually, it’s a nice looking sensor. Small, solid feeling plastic casing, feels and looks niceTo pair, you can either scan the QR code provided on the booklet that’s enclosed, but if you lose that or your QR camera is not working, the booklet provides the numbers to input. ***As well as this the Matter Code is printed on the top of the sensor it is associated with.*** Nicely discrete but accessible, should the page of the booklet be misplaced.The batteries are 2 (two) CR2450 coin batteries. As this is a brand new sensor, battery life is still to be determined, but even so it’s not something I’m too worried about. Even the “lower” estimate of two years depending on usage is nothing to sneeze at. I’d be more concerned if it was only estimated to last a few months.The only thing I’m not too pleased with is the inability to adjust distance/level parameters of the sensor without the, at time of writing, unreleased Aqara M3 HubRead more"

Set it up with HomeKit and used it in my garage for a few weeks to detect motion to turn the garage light on / off (with a Tapo light switch). The P2 stopped working after a few weeks, dead and non-responsive. So I contacted Aqara support and they sent me a replacement. I think it is a refurbished one (box was opened, the top the device does not have the Matter # on it like the original P2 I purchased). I've been unsuccessful in connecting the replacement. After going through the first steps it sits forever in the ""connecting..."" phase. I tried 30 different times, with two different iPhones (13 and 14, both running 18.3.1), same issue. I'm going to try and Onvis or Eve motion detector and see if I have better luck.I should note that I have an Aqara M2 hub and a Aqara P1 Motion Sensor used in combination with an Aqara light switch and Aqara smart plug in my utility room which works flawlessly (turns lights on/off).

Its sleek design and quick setup make it a breeze to integrate into any smart home. I’ve mounted mine in a ceiling corner of the laundry room and paired it with HomeKit via Thread.The results are astonishing: the lights turn on in less than half a second after entering the room, thanks to a simple HomeKit automation. This level of responsiveness is truly impressive. The sensor accurately detects motion without being triggered by my pets, and the ability to remove unnecessary labels adds a clean, modern touch.While I appreciate the sensor’s current sensitivity, the lack of adjustable options within Apple HomeKit is a minor disappointment. Additionally, the absence of USB-C charging feels like a missed opportunity.Despite these small drawbacks, the Motion Sensor is an excellent choice for anyone seeking reliable and fast motion detection. Its performance in my laundry room has significantly improved convenience and energy efficiency. The sensor uses an easily replaceable coin cell battery, and while I can't speak to battery life yet, the overall value for the price is impressive.Read more"

Smart Detectors,"YoLink LoRa Smart Vibration Sensor; Smart Shock, Glass Break, Tamper, Movement Detector, Generator Running, Email/SMS/Push Alerts, 1/4 Mile Open Air Range, Alexa, Hub is not Included",21.,4.5,349,https://us.amazon.com/dp/B09BKKQ7RQ,5.0,"August 12, 2024",5.0 out of 5 starsSimply Amazing!,"I have experience with multiple IOT platforms, including YoLink, Aqara, Lutron, VOCOLink, etc… and countless sensors for each, but until now I never had or tested a vibration sensor.My use case is around the need to monitor a pool pump and ensure it comes on-line each day.  As the pump is variable speed and internally computer controlled it has to be connected to power all the time so a high-power contactor is not going to work.  I thought about installing a CT probe in the power panel to monitor power usage and while that would have worked there are issues with WiFi reaching inside the metal box as well as the lack of software logic to alert proactively when there is no power usage.Anyway, I tried to simplify solving the problem by just installing a vibration sensor on the pool pump, to be able to tell and be notified when the pump comes and goes off. To hedge my bets I ordered both a YoLInk and Aqara Vibration Sensors and attached both to the pump in the same location for testing.The YoLink sensor is about 3 times larger than the Aqara one but has the advantage of using 2 x AAA batteries that are easily replaceable and since they provide more power the YoLink sensor will last longer.  The YoLink sensor also has a much more customized device configuration in the YoLink app with great options that allow me to setup an alert if the pump (vibration) does not occur in the AM when the pump starts!  Lastly,  the YoLink sensor proved to provide 10 levels of vibration sensitivity straight in their App, whereas the Aqara sensor only provides 3 levels and for changing each one you have to also press the button on the sensor. Not very practical on Aqara! Lastly, the YoLink sensor uses LoRa long range technology and has a much better connection all the way to my pool pump.I must say I am thrilled with the performance and features of the YoLink Vibration Sensor and it has solved a very frustrating problem for me which is why I wanted to recommend it.Read more"
Smart Detectors,"YoLink LoRa Smart Vibration Sensor; Smart Shock, Glass Break, Tamper, Movement Detector, Generator Running, Email/SMS/Push Alerts, 1/4 Mile Open Air Range, Alexa, Hub is not Included",21.,4.5,349,https://us.amazon.com/dp/B09BKKQ7RQ,5.0,"February 17, 2022",5.0 out of 5 starsFantastic Vibration Sensor & Very Easy to Setup/Install (using on my furnace/HVAC),"I was struggling to come up with a way to automatically turn on/off a sanitizing UVC light I installed on my HVAC ducting.  I had installed the ""REKO Lighting R2000 Air Purifier Whole House Uv uvc Light"" (purchased on Amazon) but the unit itself has no switch.  The way the unit comes, once it's plugged in, it's always on, which shortens the life of the bulbs and wastes electricity.  The light itself isn't serving any purpose if it's on while the furnace/AC is not running (since no air circulation means no air is being sanitized).  I had looked high and low for a smart vibration sensor that works with Alexa but didn't find much.  I finally came across this YoLink unit and purchased it right away. I've been super impressed with Yolink's products, and this vibration sensor certainly didn't disappoint. If you already have a YoLink hub, adding this unit takes about a minute, and can then run off the YoLink App or Alexa (including routine trigger). If you don't have their hub, you'll need another 5 minutes or so to set one up. Once I added the unite to the App, I simply set it on top of my furnace, and now when the furnace turns on, an Alexa routine triggers a smart outlet to turn the UVC light on.  When the furnace is not running, the routine triggers the outlet/light to turn off.  It could hardly work more perfectly.  I'm now dreaming up what else I could with these units.I have since bought several other YoLink products and they all work wonderfully, and they have some of the easiest setup I've experienced from any smart products. I called their tech support a few times to run a few different scenarios by them, and I always reached a person within 5 minutes.  I hope they keep it up.Yolink products have excellent range and low power consumption due to the type of wireless tech they use (LoRa).  Read up on it.  YoLink, if you read this, please give your tech support person a raise.  I spoke to the same person each time (which is amazing) and he really knew his stuff.  Message me if you want to know who it was.Read more"

It's confusing sometimes what will set them off and what won't set them off. Dog bark (their loud bark, not their normal bark), check. Lawnmower, check (less often after decreasing sensitivity). Air force fighter jet, check. Hitting the window with the side of you hand...usually. Opening the window, usually. I am very confident that if someone broke the window it would break. You may think, the sensitivity is set too high if the dog bark and mower set it off. I have adjusted the sensitivity down as low as it will go and still hitting the window (firmly) with the side of my fist and opening the window will usually set off the alarm. Decreasing the sensitivity below this will not set off the sensor with fist bump or opening the window. Overall, I would buy them again. Contact sensors on a window make no sense. Break the glass- no alert and the sensor can be disabled from their or the person can crawl through the window without an alert.Read more"

The integration with zigbee2mqtt is seamless and exactly as expected—this is actually a significant advantage that may not be immediately obvious. It also works flawlessly with Home Assistant Automations.The only reason I’m not giving it 5 stars is that it occasionally experiences interference from my 5 GHz Wi-Fi network. This is likely partially my fault, as my high-powered Ubiquiti AP is located just 3 feet above the device. I suspect it uses the 6 GHz band for its radar functions, which might be close enough in frequency to the 5 GHz Wi-Fi signals to cause interference.Overall, it’s a reliable and well-designed product that meets my needs, with only minor drawbacks that are likely due to environmental factors.Read more"

Sonoff REALLY needs to fix this POS device. They don't seem to be concerned that they are taking people's money as there hasn't been a firmware update in ages. I don't recommend this sensor. If you want a much better device buy the Aqara FP1E presence sensor. The SNZB-06P was half the price of the FP1E but I guess you get what you pay for.Edit: I increased my review by 2 stars. After working with the sensor for a while I discovered that the magnetic metal base really interfered with the signal. So, I removed the base and just used command strips to hold it in place (you can use anything nonmetal you want). The sensor started working well!

Biggest problem is in it not flipping back to motion not detected after detecting motion.  Even with the lowest sensitivity.  I tried reinstalling the driver multiple times but didn't seem to help any.  The information and user guides were quite confusing leaving me with many questions.  There is a sensitivity setting in the app, but I believe the button on the side of the device adjust the sensitivity as well, but they don't seem to match or affect each other.

I needed something affordable for office use and wasn’t expecting much at this price point, but it actually delivered better than I thought it would.It works pretty well even in a lit room, which was a key need for me. The focus was solid, and I appreciated that the image stayed clear enough for presentations, especially when the projector was positioned closer to the screen. Definitely one of those “the closer, the better” situations, but that’s expected for compact projectors.One small but thoughtful feature I really liked was the built-in foot—it made it super easy to angle the projector without having to stack it on books or improvise a stand.For the price, it’s a great value. It’s not a high-end device, but for basic office or casual use, this little projector gets the job done.Read more"

Last week I started receiving messages whenever I turned on my 9 year old 32"" Vizio, that Netflix and other apps would no longer be supported.  This means only satellite TV or old fashioned antennas would result in a picture.  Since I cut the cable 2 years ago, this meant the perfectly working TV would be useless to me.  I gave it to a friend who wanted it as a computer monitor.  Because I have another Vizio and it gives me good sound and good picture for a reasonable price I decided to order this one.Set up was very simple.  Adding streaming apps was fast and there are a LOT to chose from; both free and subscription.  When I tuned it to a program, I thought the sound was kind of muffled and hard to hear without increasing the volume pretty high.  So I went into the settings and under Audio there are 3 options for sound quality.  Factory set up was the worst (muffled) option.  I chose the option that produced clear, sharp annunciation without having high volume.  Because of this, it's the best sound quality of any of my 3 current TVs.Picture is great and almost no lag time when changing programs or channels.  I had no trouble with inserting the feet - screws and holes lined up perfectly.  I am once again very happy with my Vizio TV.  As each older TV bites the dust, each will be replaced with a Vizio.Read more"

This Vizio solved both of those problems.  The picture is sharp and clear and the bluetooth feature works like a charm!  I'm an older lady but I didn't have any trouble getting it out of the box and setting it up.  The legs were tricky to attach and I wished I had one of those magnetized screwdrivers but once I had them on there was no problem with screws not fitting or the TV tipping. The plethora of programming choices is overwhelming but in the end I went back to using my TV firestick in HDMI2.  The remote control that comes with the Vizio is super sensitive and take just a touch to move the cursor around the screen.

Excellent 40"" TV With All The Right Stuff!","This Visio smart TV is a winner! We needed a medium-size TV for our guest bedroom...  but didn't want to spend a bunch for a set that would be watched only occasionally. This Visio 40"" smart TV has a beautiful HD picture with images that pop. It has all the technology and bells and whistles most folks could possibly want. Wall mounting and setup is a snap with no unpleasant surprises.  The remote is terrific and intuitive. We couldn't be more pleased with the picture, the features, the appearance, and the price of this excellent Visio smart TV.For decades, we have purchased only top-quality and super reliable Sony televisions. We currently own two new very large Sony TVs and are totally satisfied with their performance. When shopping for a smaller TV for our guest room, we were surprised at the spendy $500 price for the Sony. A bit of online research offered this great 40"" Visio for only $138. The decision to buy was a no-brainer.After viewing this new Visio for some time, we compared it with our Sony TVs. The picture quality, the smart TV features, and the design & build of the Visio are truly at a quality level comparable to our favorite Sonys -- and at a genuine bargain price. Check out this outstanding Visio smart TV...  you'll be glad you did.Read more"

I couldn't get a new 1st Gen, so I got this one. It was easy to set up the first time and hook up to my existing Google Home. It worked fine the first day or so. Then, a few days later, following a power outage, it said it needed to be hooked up to the Google Home app. I couldn't get this to work without doing a factory reset. and it took days to have time to find the instructions. I got it hooked up and it worked for another day or two. It had been unplugged, so I thought that was the issue. After doing another factory reset and hooking it up again, we were very careful to avoid power outages, but it again stopped working soon after an unknown number of days (hadn't used it for some time). Did the factory reset, and now it spoke Japanese until we got it hooked up. As it was past the 30 day window, we couldn't return it. Have reset once or twice since then, hoping to get it to work, but it never stays more than a day or two. I love our other two, or I'd already be replacing all with Amazon Echo Speakers. As it is, we're replacing this with one, and will do the same should the others fail.Read more"

The box is labelled all in Japanese, and when you first plug in the unit it speaks in Japanese.  Once you connect to your Google Home app, it speaks in whatever language that is configured for.  Installation is not as easy as expected, before you can connect to Google home you must download and run the Device Utility app.  I'm disappointed by this as I would have expected a Google product to be configured to work directly with the Google home app.  Once up and running, the Google assistant works well and the sound quality is very good for such a small speaker.Read more"

I bought the black soundbar at Costco, and I wanted white rear speakers since they’d be in front of the white wainscoting.The soundbar itself is fantastic — a huge improvement over what I had before — and the rear speakers are what really bring everything to life, especially when I’m not wearing my hearing aids.I get to hear doctors being paged when watching The Pitt, gunfire in the distance while watching Paradise, birds chirping in Wicked, and so many other noises in other shows and movies that round out the viewing experience.Two important things:1. You pair the speakers and control their volume through the Bose app. Mine are at 80, and the “height” channel on my soundbar is at 20. You’ll figure out the right ratio for you.2. I have a very small TV room, and my rear speakers are on the Bose stands (a bit pricey but I kept them anyway) right behind the couch. I can’t speak to what the sound would be like in a much bigger room with these mounted on the wall, but I’m sure they’d be great. I could do that setup with hearing aids in, but they probably wouldn’t help me in a big room if my hearing aids are out.Read more"

As many customers share here, the voice coming from speakers was very, very low, almost no difference. Started thinking those are next $418 we spent for nothing...BUT I have decided to believe and trust the brand (that's a Bose, it could not be that worse), same as you trust when you buy Mercedes.... Checked here and there, and found the solution (unfortunately not here), and sharing it with you as a New Year Gift ( if you decide to buy me a beer, I would accept :)  )So the solution of low sound coming form your new surround speakers is to install on your phones a Bose Mobile app.There are few. ""Bose Connect"" and ""Bose Music"" will not work with soundbar 300, they do with 500/700.For soundbar 300 model you need ""Bose SoundTouch"" app. It works using your home Wi-Fi to connect your phone/app with the soundbar. To prepare your soundbar for connection, press your soundtouch button on your remote, then press and hold 9.Open the app and follow instructions. It will also check for updates ( I even didn't know this sound system could get updates, so did it for a first time in 2 years since I bought it. Update took a while, about 15 minutes).When you are connected, on app under settings you could find ""Audio Settings"". There you can adjust the Central Level and your Surround Level, last one is what is bothering you, hit it to 10 :)  Test your sound now.Merry Christmas and a Happy and noisy New 2020 :)Read more"

I mostly listen to music and not very interest in the theatre surround sound. With the soundbar on, I turned off the surround sound speakers no change. I could not tell if they were actually working. I attempted to do the ADAPTiQ, it would only pick up one of the speakers and then told me there was too much noise. I was the only one in the room. I attempted several times and a failure message continued to prevent completion of the iQ check. I spent 4 hours with a Bose technician, no help.

It’s a statement piece, an audio flex, and—if you’re like me—a borderline obsession.✅ Why This Soundbar is in a League of Its Own:• Dolby Atmos Performance: The immersive surround is otherworldly. Movies, music, even YouTube—everything sounds like you upgraded to a private cinema. You feel the detail in the air, not just blasting at you from the front.• Voice Clarity that’s Unreal: Dialogue Mode and the custom-tuned center channel make speech perfectly crisp, even when explosions are happening in the background. No more riding the remote volume button.• Pure Aesthetic Pleasure: The white finish is chef’s kiss. Modern, bright, and impossibly elegant. It doesn’t just disappear under your TV—it elevates the entire space. I’ve had more than one guest say, “Wait, that’s a Bose?”• Smart Features that Actually Work: Alexa and Google Assistant built in, AirPlay 2 support, and seamless integration with Bose Music App. No clunky setups or lag—just instant connectivity.✅ Pro Tips for Peak Experience:• Pair it with the Bose Bass Module 700 and Bose Surround Speakers 700—trust me, you’ll never look back. The low end will shake your soul in the best way.• Use Dialogue Mode for streaming and late-night sessions. It keeps vocals crisp without waking up the entire house.• If you can, mount it just below eye level for that floating, gallery-like presentation.✅ Why It’s 5 Stars—No Debate:• White colorway: stunning and rare in a sea of black rectangles• Unmatched clarity and warmth in every frequency• Rock-solid build that feels premium the moment you unbox it• A setup so clean it looks pulled from an Architectural Digest spreadBottom line: If you want luxury sound that feels as good as it looks, this is the bar to own.5 stars—Bose proves yet again why they’re the standard everyone else is chasing.Read more"

Install Bose Music app to setup the Soundbar. Bose 600 Soundbar is already an amazing soundbar and this soundbar fills the gaps in the room with louder sound in more spots.Pros:1) Bose devices can connect to each other wirelessly which is useful for playing same music in multiple rooms or to have a personal experience on a device like your Bose Headset for the same content.2) The sound is loud enough for any size room and will definitely fill the entire room with sound. Lot of times you will be confused whether someone is really ringing bell or the sound is coming from the soundbar, its that real.3) AdaptIQ makes the job of tuning your soundbar to your room and your situation (furniture etc blocking the sound) seamless. There is an option to disable AdaptIQ if required.4) Like Bose 600 you can integrate TV and Soundbar control through HDMI ARC connection using a single remote. Typically I don’t use Bose Soundbar remote at all.5) Also like Bose 600 you can control Bass, Treble, Center/Height Chanel, group multiple devices, add audio delay, select source, power on/off, update firmware, enable/disable many setting including Voice Control/Chromecast through the Bose Music app.6) Premium look and feel and heavier than Bose 600.7) Wireless option to add rear speakers and bass module.8) Support for Voice control like Google/Alexa, cast audio from phone/laptop using Bluetooth or Wifi. Dolby Atmos and Upfiring speaker which help with situation like Rain fall will feel like its raining in the room. AI DIalogue mode are some of the great features.What I wish for:1) Soundbar (atleast for 900/Ultra) should be sold with the Bass Module as that really completes the thunderous sound experience as this product is primarily for larger rooms.2) This is the first time that it took me more time to put the power cord on the back of the soundbar. Not sure whether the power cord I received was the right fit for the socket.3) Switching/Changing wifi is a pain when it doesn’t work in the first attempt although there are detailed videos on Youtube from Bose with instructions. Something as simple as a tiny wifi reset button on the soundbar would help.Read more"

A quirk when using the Spotify App exists where to initially start playing on the Soundbar you want to start playing audio on the iPhone first and then switch over to the Soundbar as the Soundbar doesn’t seem to connect if there isn’t an audio signal already playing.Each way of connecting worked, but I will most often use the Spotify App or Apple TV. Directly connecting to the Soundbar from the Spotify app is the most responsive way to start and stop and change the music.Sound quality is good, build quality is good, I’m happy with it. I don’t have additional speakers in the room. Playing movies with 5.1 support or 5.1.2 support works well. Dialog is clear even without the special AI option.The Bose Music App is easy to use and allows you to tweak Height, Center, Bass, and Treble levels but I didn't feel the need to change these. For CEC settings, besides on and off you can set other variations in case you are getting odd interactions between connected equipment like the TV getting turned back on when you are just accessing the soundbar via Airplay 2. I use the setting called Option 6 to avoid having the TV turn back on just after turning it off. There is a choice of having the Soundbar automatically turn off after 20 minutes if not being used, but I set it to never automatically turn off as it is a bit confusing when you go back to your TV which is still on but the Soundbar is turned off.I wish it had on/off and play/pause buttons on the bar as I find that feature useful on Sonos speakers from time to time. I think if you are already bought in to the Sonos ecosystem, the Sonos Arc is a better choice because it is also high quality and syncs so well with other Sonos speakers you may already own.Read more"

They sound fantastic.  Some times I like to sit in my Living room and read, or meditate. But I would turn the volume up in the family room so I could hear those speakers. So I decided to get a third  Era 100 for my living room. I put it on a small decorative shelf.  I must say it is everything I imagined it would be. When setting it up I didn't know I could turn off selected speakers. This was a unexpected plus for me. So if I am in my living room I could just have the one Era 100 speaker play and vice versa. Or I could have all three and the sub mini playing at the same time. After having the 2 Era 100's and Sub mini for a couple of months now, I had forgotten how good just 1 Era 100 speaker sound. I did notice the two Era 100's paired with the sub sound more clear and crisp than the single Era 100's. That's because the Sub mini is using the low that the Era 100's would had normally played. Great concept in sound and speakers.  I just turned the treble up a little bit more in the single Era 100 to get more highs. Sounds good. It's too bad Sonos doesn't allow for multiple Sub minis connected in the same group, it would be phenomenal. I had read somewhere that it wasn't cost effective for the consumer to buy 2 Sub minis when 1 Gen 3 Sub woofer has more output than two Sub minis. I say who cares Sonos? If a consumer wants to spend their money on a second Sub mini and put in in another room in the same speaker group it's their prerogative. If that's true then their business model doesn't make since to me. Set up was a breeze too. Because I didn't use a tutorial to set this up, it took me a few minutes to figure out how to select the speaker, because at first the single Era 100 didn't play although it was connected.  But the setup was a breeze. Very easy. I may get another Era 100 (this time used) and put it in my kitchen and I'll have sound throughout all of downstairs. I've been fortunate to not have problems with the app, unlike many others. I am very impressed and satisfied.Read more"

We don’t have the strongest or most advanced WiFi network so I anticipated having issues—and I did.I hit my frustration threshold after trying for a couple hours to connect to my WiFi in the initial system setup. The simplest of things were just not working and troubleshooting tips online weren’t helping. Left them alone to tackle it again the next day.I had the same issues on the next attempt. So I gave in and called Sonos Support—they were wonderful. I had to download an app on my laptop and download a couple updates. The customer service rep guided me through the process and was just as excited as I was when we got everything working properly.I mention all this first because I know concerns about connectivity/issues with the app might stop a lot of people from buying these. While certainly not as easy as it should be, issues were fixed relatively easily through Sonos support.And my God—the sound quality of these speakers are amazing. You forget any troubles you had the moment you turn up the volume on your favorite music. I do consider myself an amateur audiophile and these speakers are worth the money. Hopefully Sonos is making progress with their system so that less people have to call support just for the initial setup. Removed half a star just for this.TLDR: Connectivity issues are real but fixable; sound quality is amazing.Read more"

Utterly Useless for streaming music due to horrible software,"What a shame. When they work the sound is amazing. The problem. They never work for streaming music because of a woeful update to its software. Even the NYT, which once recommended the system as the best has changed its mind. About three months ago Sonos updated its system software that literally rendered my entire Sonos speaker system (This Sonos Era 100 included) useless. To use this system as a music streaming device, you must use the Sonos App. Sonos used to have one of the best apps in the business. Intuitive with amazing functionality. A few months ago they tried to update it, basically trying to make it look more like Amazon music. It was an utter failure. Folks like me are wanting to sell their entire system. I stayed with sonos for three months now since they promised they would make things right. They have not. The speakers stop streaming music after playing just one song. Nearly no commands work correctly. When I tell it to stop playing a song. It does not listen. I manually have to press the button on the speaker. This system was developed so you could talk to it and play all music across an entire CD. That used to be possible. Now it is not. Literally stops playing after one song. Via voice prompt, when you tell it to go to the next song, it cannot. We Sonos music streamers have lost the capability to stream music directly from our device's own music library. Many of us bought Sonos because we wanted to have great speakers that would directly play music from our phones or our shared music library folders on our computers. That functionality has ceased to exist. Run! Don't walk. And return these speakers. Their only use today is as a bluetooth device where you have to physically press each song you want to move onto via whatever controlling system you have for bluetooth. The Sonos incompetence here I cannot overstate. A once great company and music system has fallen. Such a shame. It did not have to be this way.  If I could speak to the CEO of Sonos I would tell him this:  Your bread and butter was your speaker system, not headphones, not other products. Get back to the basics. Restore the streaming functionality that allowed us to enjoy music via touchless voice commands and software that was once top notch. I have five Sonos speakers for sale. I hate to do it, but I am making all my speakers Amazon speakers. At least Amazon respects it customers by doing research before launching new products that destroy the functionality of what used to be. Goodbye, Sonos. Forever!Read more"

I was surprised by how small the device is (I attached a size comparison with a pen). Setup was pretty easy, I just followed the instructions in the manual, and then connected the smart life skill to use the device with Alexa.MY USE CASEI have this controlling 3 devices: projector, TV, and soundbar. My goal in getting this was to easily transition between using my PS4 while sitting at my desk on my TV, to laying in bed on my projector, and vice versa. This worked out perfectly by using an Alexa routine (see attached video). I was a little worried that a device like this would only emit IR in one direction, similar to a remote, however, it was able to reach 3 devices on separate sides of the room. Amazing! I even pushed it behind my TV and it still works.INSTRUCTIONS TO ADD ANY BUTTON TO AN ALEXA ROUTINEI highly recommend you screenshot this section for later if you intend on using Alexa routines with this product.1. Setup the device as shown in the manual2. Add your device to the smart life app, most devices are already in their database, if it isn’t, choose the most similar device.3. Once the device is added, open the remote for it. If there’s a button that you want that’s not included with the default remote, add a custom button. This will have you point your remote towards the device and hold the button to add, works perfectly.4. Once all the buttons that you want are on the remote in the smart life app, then go to the smart tab in the smart life app and click on the tap-to-run menu. Here you’ll have to create a tap-to-run task for each function that you would like Alexa to receive.5. Once you have all the tap-to-run tasks working within the smart life app, go to the Alexa app, and search for the smart life skill and connect it to your account.6. In the Alexa app, go to the devices tab, click the “+” in the upper right hand corner, tap add device, then scroll to the bottom and tap other. This will pull in all the tap-to-run tasks into Alexa. Alexa will recognize them as scenes, therefore, you will find them in the scenes menu.7. Now you’re ready to create your Alexa routine like normal and just add the appropriate scene to your routine.** if you found this helpful please let me know by clicking ‘helpful’ **Read more"

I've had a Logitech Harmony hub for my primary TV for quite a while. After getting this one, I set it up with the Smart Life app and was just blown away with how well it worked. It had my Hannspree TV in its database, so I didn't need any special programming to get that working. The only thing that it didn't have in the database was my Roku. But it was very easy to add it in. Not only does it have an IR blaster, it also has an IR receiver, which allows it to learn codes from an original device remote.  With that, I was able to add all of the Roku functions that I need. After seeing up the devices, it is very easy to make up some smart routines to operate there TV and other items. And just after making the routine, it showed up in the Alexa app.The biggest issue that I have with the Logitech Harmony hub is that it doesn't seem possible to set a toggle switch for turning things on or off. They required 2 separate actions.  Not true with this unit though. You can set it to turn on or off many items.  The toggle worked out so well that I decided to set it up with one of my Echo Buttons. Now whenever I want to watch TV or turn it off, I just hit the big button and it does its thing.As for the controller itself, it's very nice. Compact and plain in appearance, it does a big job. It has a USB C plug and comes with a small USB cable, but no power supply. It has just one small button on it for putting it into pairing mode. Other than that, everything is done through changing settings in the SmartLife app.Read more"

Price wise is unreal this things works better than ir blasters that cost 2 and 4 times more than it.  I tried a broadlink mini and then a harmony hub before trying and loving this one.  It has enough devices in it that most everything is in there that you would need.  It's small but it works really well.  Integration into alexa is the main reason as to why I like this one so much.  Harmony's integration is simply terrible and the broadlink mini I never even got on my wifi.  I really like automation you can do in the smart life app for multi commands on multiple devices that get picked up by alexa as scenes.  I got the one with temp and humidity because why not, and it's really accurate.  The ifttt I played with and works fine, but don't intend to use it much.The cons on this device starts with the smart life app in general.  I personally don't like it because it feels  cluttered.  You can't group things and I have a several devices in it now like lights and switches along with two of these ir's now and all the remotes that I set up in the ir.  So it's an eye sore of an app with all the devices and remotes on the front page.  Personally I prefer structure so it's a con for me anyway.  Roku isn't an available device you can select in the setup and the DIY/Custom learning function is painfully irratating.  You click the button to learn then it just randomly goes away, after a couple tries it will finally stay up and try to learn the button.  Best advice, if you are using that is just keep trying to add it over and over and over again until it finally works and adds because it eventually will.Regarding roku ultra's, you are out of luck on the ok button fully working. Roku in general integrates ok into alexa but has some issues mainly with prime video and voice commands.  The blaster was able to learn the ok button but it doesn't work when it's in prime video for some reason through the blaster, I can use the learned one in the main menu and it works in netflix and a couple other apps though which was weird.  Best guess is the ok button is sending multiple commands and the blaster is only picking up one.  I have an older universal remote that the roku ok button works fine on also, but never could get the ir blaster to learn what the universal remote was sending at all.Read more"

It provided a more immersive sound than the built in speakers in my TV, but I needed subtitles when watching movies because I was able to discern only about 70% of spoken American dialogue and only 50% of the dialogue in British movies. Now, with the Sonos Beam, I can clearly understand 100% of American dialogue and over 90% of British dialogue. I cannot hear a difference between the Sonos regular setting and the enhanced speech setting, but being able to tweak bass and treble settings was helpful. I no longer require subtitles when watching movies on TV.The setup, via the IOS app, is straightforward and it would have been quick and easy to get the Sonos Beam to work with my TV except that I ran into a problem. Sonos tech support was excellent. They ran diagnostics and isolated the source of the problem as residing with the TV’s accessory HDMI ports, and not due to an issue with the soundbar. -  Kudos to LG support for correcting the issue in minutes, right through the TV internet connection. -  Once the ports were back in service, the Sonos beam recognized my TV in seconds. Had I not had the problem with the accessory HDMI ports, total setup time for the Sonos Beam would have been less than five minutes.The IOS app is easy to use but it’s a bit awkward. Volume control is easy to find and use, but getting to the page that allows you to fine tune the soundbar is not intuitive. And I do not like the prominent advertisements for other Sonos products. Ads should not be a part of a control device. But that’s a minor point. I’m pleased with the Sonos Beam and with the Sonos company. It deserves a 5 star rating.Read more"

I read review after review. Why did I want a sound bar....I have a Samsung Smart ""Big Screen"" TV but was always dissatisfied with the sound quality from the on board speakers, even when I tried the different settings. My wife did not want lots of speakers and ""stuff"" but was ok with a neat sound bar. I looked for something with reasonable reviews and not over the top expensive. After much work I eventually selected the Sonos over several alternatives.It arrived and I set it up using the instructions, worked straight from box, no issues at all, so 5* for that. Second, the immediate difference in sound quality was great improvement over the on board TV speakers, I switch from TV to soundbar several times to make sure I was just not being biased because I wanted the soundbar to be better, it was, so 5*. I then scrolled through my FIOS channel selector and selected big sound movies, sports with crowd background, studio debates, nature shows with animal sounds with narration, cartoons and studio news programs, they all sounded better on the Sonos so another 5*. Lastly the looks, it is sleek enough to be unobtrusive and sits on a shelf under the TV without really being noticeable at all so another 5*.Overall I am very pleased with the decision to purchase this soundbar. I can't vouch for how much better or worse it is than any other soundbar, but it was worth the money for how much better it is compared to the TV speakersRead more"

My wife gave it to me on Sunday. I spent the whole evening putting it up in programming. It only need to find that it did not have any volume whatsoever when it came to streaming for my computer when you went to the TV the volume went up a little, but that is all I contacted the manufacturer through Amazon. The manufacturer told me that the profit margin on this product was great for Amazon and you need to go back to Amazon to get a return. Amazon told me to go back to the manufacturer so I sit here wondering why do I have to go back-and-forth why can't they honor the return policy?

Think twice before you purchase they promise you all kinds of things but good luck on getting him to honor it my name is Randy. I have retired so I live on a fixed income, but the grid out there is overwhelming. Thank you.Read more"

Our sons purchased a sixty-inch Samsung TV for us, which has high-definition viewing, but the sound bounces around the big, open spaces. We connected our older sound bar, but the sound was still not focused enough to catch all of the changes in pitch and decibel ranges. This system was a bit tricky to sync until my husband downloaded the digital manual, LOL. The quality of the surround sound system is amazing! Because we have young children who frequently visit, we are delighted that we could place the speakers that go ""behind"" one's seating area on the soffits/cabinets above the stove and refrigerator. Now, I can listen to interviews, news reports, and DIY programs without stopping my food prep to try to understand what individuals are actually sharing in their conversations. This system is definitely worth the extra cost--- we consider the price to be a fair market value. We too used a Star Wars movie to test the surround sound elements, as discovered in the video posts we watched to determine how to troubleshoot the syncing of the speaker system with the television. The John Williams fanfare and background sounds are rich in tone and celebratory! Resolving our sound issues felt like a victory! I hope this review will help you make a decision and that you will seek a digital manual for a simple solution for syncing the speakers.Read more"

This projector is great for a backyard movie night and also at home for watching movies. I do not use the projector for presentations. At 3,000 lumens, this projector is very bright, and even with some daylight coming in, projects an excellent picture at 120 inches. You can hear the fan a little, however, you can adjust your image brightness to eco which will lower the fan noise. If you're watching a movie in the dark chances are you will be using eco mode anyway.Watching movies on the included streaming dongle and Blu-rays is excellent. The colors really pop. Unless you're comparing this to a  more expensive movie projector, the low contrast ratio black/gray levels wasn't noticeable and did not affect my viewing of movies.When watching in a very large room, the 5 watt speaker was a little underwhelming. However you can add an external Bluetooth speaker. Still,it was adequate when watching a movie in a living room.Please note that this projector only has one HDMI port. Therefore if you want to watch a movie using blu-ray player you will have to switch back and forth between that and the included streaming dongle.The projector does not have an internal battery. Therefore make sure you have an outlet when watching movies in your backyard.I am really pleased with this, 3000 lumens, 1080P projector, at $349. This is a great buy when compared to other similar projectors which cost alot more. It's great for indoor and outdoor for watching movies and sports at 120 in, even with some daylight.Read more"

I bought it for backyard movie and football nights with my family. I don't know anything about projectors but knew I wanted to (a) start movies before sunset (small kids with early-ish bedtimes), (b) stream movies and TV, and (c) easily set up and take down the projector. And of course I didn't want to spend a gazillion dollars. This little projector hits all of my goals. It is, honestly, a bit hard to see the picture while the sun is setting, even using a screen, but it's good enough for my family. Otherwise, the picture is really bright and clear and looks awesome. The built-in speakers are pretty good, and it was easy connecting a Bluetooth speaker for a birthday party movie night. The streaming stick is great -- I love that it's housed in the projector casing, making it easy to keep together. Set up and take down couldn't be easier. The automatic adjusting key has worked great at various heights. I really don't think I could have made a better choice for the money. My only complaint is that my remote control for the projector itself seems to not work right. But I assume I got a lemon, and I can control most things with the streaming stick remote, so even that really hasn't been a problem.Read more"

As a first foray into projectors, this has been a great investment both for my business (Healthcare education presenter) and home (kids love the theater-style movie nights!).Ease of use:Aside from the panel being a slight PITA to open, you can get this up and running in no time. The Amazon TV plug-in is genius and simple to navigate. I didn't need to do anything special when using the standard features for presenting - it is truly a plug-and-play machine.Picture quality:For under $300, I wasn't holding my breath on picture quality. However, this projecter puts out enough lumens to easily present in a semi-lit conference room. Movies do best with significantly more darkness, but you can still see fairly well without full-dark.As you can see in the picture, its visible even with a fully-lit room.Read more"

Definitely happy with the purchase.There is one thing that disappointed me a bit though… when using an HDMI cable, you can control the volume on the sound bar with the TV remote instead of having to use the included Bose remote.Unfortunately, when trying to take advantage of this feature, there is quite a bit of lag. When trying to turn up the volume, you’ll hit the button once or twice and nothing will happen. Then all of a sudden your volume goes from a quarter of the way up to almost full blast. And it’s just as wacky trying to get the volume turned back down again. I have a Sony Bravia TV that’s only about a year and a half old so I doubt that is the issue and I tried multiple brand new cables to make sure that that wasn’t causing it. I think it’s just the time that it takes the sound bar to respond to the TV input.Like I said, it is a bummer but the sound quality is amazing. I just switched to an optical audio cable and am dealing with having multiple remotes.If I knew of another product that was actually responsive with the regular TV remote, I would probably return this and go that route, but I don’t want to be buying and returning sound bars for the rest of my life. I’m blessed to have a problem as small as using two remotes instead of one.Read more"

I love that it has top-facing speaker grilles, which allow the sound to project upward. Other, more expensive bars often have a glass surface on top, which limits vertical sound projection. With this one, sound flows forward, sideways, upward, and backward—creating a fully immersive experience.I later added the Bose Bass Module 500 via wired connection, and the improvement in low-end response was immediate. However, even without the subwoofer, the soundbar performs very well when watching Dolby Atmos content.Using your TV’s eARC port is key. In my setup, I connected the Apple TV to HDMI 1 and the soundbar to HDMI 2 (eARC) on my 70” LG QNED TV. Proper configuration avoids annoying black screen flickers while the system negotiates the audio format. I recommend disabling Apple TV’s automatic frame rate and dynamic range switching, and on the LG TV, setting the audio output to “passthrough” instead of “auto.”Finally, adding the Bose Surround Speakers 300 (also applies to the 700s) takes the system to a whole new level. In my large, closed room, you can truly feel effects surround you—like a bullet whizzing past your right ear. Just amazing.Read more"

After experiencing firsthand how easy it was to integrate them into my existing and very average home Wi-Fi system - not to mention tie their control into existing Amazon smart devices such as my Echo Dot and EchoPop - I simply couldn't resist the urge to (join the rest of you in the 21st century and) purchase a camera.APPLICATION: I wanted an easy to buy, implement, use and maintain a remote controllable and reasonably 'smart' surveillance system - just to keep an eye on things that happen on the street. I learned very quickly the Kasa camera system has features that enable it to not only track motion but specifically people when desired (see Activity Zones IMG) ; features include various levels of tracking up to and including ""Patrol Mode"" which will cause the camera to rotate through the four savable ""scenes"" at the specified interval(s) allowing for 360° monitoring from just one camera. Even has NIGHT VISION.I actually bought two cameras and haven't even set up the second one because the first is already doing so much!TIPS & TRICKS: Make sure you purchase a reasonable quality 64 GB mini SD card. That is the maximum size card this model of Kasa camera can utilize. TO INSERT THE CARD: using the mobile interface pan the camera upward until the mini SD card port and reset buttons are exposed (see IMGs.) Insert the card LABEL UP and press until firmly clicked and secured in its final position. I have been running the camera ""24/7"" (the actual mode is known as ""24/7 Monitoring"") at maximum resolution of 1080p for ~ 3 days and have used less than 25% of the 64 GB capacity. (see IMGs)HOW TO SAVE EVIDENCE: Should something unfortunate occur and you find yourself in the position of needing to save that which your camera captured you can simply click on ""24/7 recording"" & move the saved timeline bar to the requisite point, wait for playback to start and click the 🔴 in the lower right-hand portion on the playback screen. (Note: Give the video recall some time - after all it is the camera having to go back and read saved data while still recording and saving new data, transmit saved data through the Wi-Fi network to your phone and ultimately save it in a new location. Even the fastest systems will take a moment.) Following these steps will save a video of what was recorded that you will find in your video gallery. *There is a portion of the app allocated to Activity Alerts Tracking which is available with a Kasa Care subscription; I do not have that subscription thus I am unable to speak to those features at this time but imagine they facilitate easier activity recall and saving.WHAT TO DO NOW: Click purchase. 😊 Seriously this thing is fabulous especially for the price point. Off the top of my head some of the easiest applications I can think of would be keeping an eye on your pets or your kids while they're at home or having an extra pair of eyes when needed.*** Keep in mind this review is written from the standpoint of someone seeking easy applications and easy use - If you are looking for something that is sturdy, has own/redundant power, data storage and signaling capacity, is designed to survive not only adverse weather/climate but also potential tampering this is not the device I would recommend.Read more"

I do however, have a few slight issues... This one (1080p model) has a different port for power. Which is okay, but definitely going to be a little more difficult to find replacements for. The range of motion on this model is also very strange; you can manually move it to certain points but that changes the movement you can do with the app functions. I got this one as a refurbished model, but I don't think there's a difference, as I also bought a brand new 2k model, and it seems to be the same. Which brings me to my next point; the video quality of the 2k version, compared to the 1080p version seems to be exactly the same, especially when it is in motion. There are several quality drops (even on 1gbps internet speeds and phone on WiFi). All-in-all I would probably buy another of these cameras if I needed it, just for the movements and alerts, at the price they are right now.Read more"

To make matters worse it costs $45 which is the most expensive brick I ever owned in my life so I returned it for a full refund and decided to try 1 more time with a cheaper but comparable camera. That's when I picked this up.I went in a skeptic assuming I would have the same problems as I always did with WYZE(tried a v3 or maybe v2 years ago, same problem as the v4 so I guess WYZE is just incapable of actual improvement and favors dumb gimmicks instead. The only thing that changed was the app layout which admittedly LOOKS better now but looks can be deceiving...)Turns out I was wrong and NOT every camera on Amazon is an overpriced pile of junk! This camera is half the price, connected immediately with 0 delays and functions exactly as advertised. This cameras App has performed nearly perfectly and I can even move this camera FAR from my router without any impact on the signal quality. I can keep my phone on 5G and STILL use EVERY feature on the app. I can also be far away from my router, house, and this camera without losing any features. That means I can get notified of activities, pan/tilt manually, toggle NV, change app settings/schedules, set up to 4 viewpoints, set detection zones in said viewpoints, record manually, turn the status LED on/off, download recorded activities(manual recordings OR detection-based recordings) and Etc...The cloud service is cheap but in a GOOD way. Only $3/month per device(up to 4) or $10/month for up to 10 devices which is extremely affordable.The quality of videos is very good IMO although I do wish the Frame rate was a little higher(I don't KNOW the exact Frame Rate but I'm a big time Gamer who just loves loves LOVES to toggle his FPS display ON and set it to high accuracy mode.) Based on what I have seen so far I think it's about 10-15 FPS so really fast movements will look like a smudge but natural movements shouldn't have that problem. It might not be the BEST option for monitoring(I don't know WHAT is cause this is only my 3rd attempt at finding a decent camera for basic monitoring but it's gone above and beyond my expectations at this pricepoint.) I'm actually about to get 2 or 3 more of these once I finish and submit my updated review.Some notes:When you plug it in for the first time it will probably start moving suddenly on it's own, this is NORMAL. It's a way to test the motor and range of motion for the pan/tilt feature and can be done manually in the app as well. I've moved to different outlets twice now and it has not done that on it's own either time leading me to believe it's only a one-time automated check up of sorts.By coincidence, I found one minor flaw on the app which I'm not sure was a fluke or an actual Bug. I was watching a live video feed and tried to manually record something I wasn't sure would trigger motion detection but apparently it DID and my fool self forgot about the minor delay so it popped up in my notification panel ""Activity detected on ___"" but did not appear in the app right away so I refreshed it. When I went to reciew download itRead more"

Only buy them if you need them in the near term and can't find something with better local use functionality.When the ""Blink Cloud"" goes down, the Blink app becomes unavailable, all of your cameras will be disarmed, you will be unable to view any of the cameras (wired or otherwise), doorbell will not sound, and the whole system will become useless until it is resolved. And savvy thieves will pay attention when there is an outage and exploit it.So far, this has happened exactly once since I've installed almost 10 of these around the house. But if that happened during a genuine outage, this also means when Blink goes out of business or simply decides they don't want to support these anymore, they all become unusable e-waste and your money becomes trash.I bought these with the promise of storing video locally through my own network. If I had known even the local recordings are unavailable when their cloud servers go offline, I would not have bought these.Read more"

Just don’t expect cinematic quality video—or to easily share access with anyone else.⸻My ExperienceI bought this little camera mainly for indoor security, and it’s done a decent job so far. It’s so compact and cute that it looks more like a tiny robot pet than a camera. Bonus: the white color blends nicely into my white walls, so it doesn’t scream “surveillance.”The app is user-friendly, and I appreciate the motion-detection recordings. The 6-foot power cord was a pleasant surprise—long enough to reach my high wall outlets without extension cables.That said, video quality leaves something to be desired. It’s supposed to be 1080p, but it feels closer to “meh-720p” in certain lighting conditions. And here’s the kicker: you can’t actually share access with other Amazon accounts. I thought I was just missing something, but nope—it’s by design. You need to log in with the same Blink account across all devices if you want others to access the camera feed.⸻Pros and ConsPros:• Super compact and adorable design—blends in almost too well• Matches white walls perfectly, no visual clutter• App-based recording and motion alerts work smoothly• Comes with a surprisingly long power cable (about 6 feet!)Cons:• Video quality is a bit soft, especially in dim lighting• Can’t share camera access with other Amazon/Blink accounts(you have to share your login credentials to allow access from another device)⸻Tips & Reality CheckIf you were hoping to invite your partner or housemate to view the feed from their own account: sorry, not happening. Blink doesn’t support multi-user permissions. The only workaround is logging into the same account on multiple devices—functional, but not ideal for privacy.Also, if image quality is important to you, consider checking out the Blink Mini 2—it offers better low-light performance and wider field of view.⸻Final VerdictIf you’re looking for a basic, affordable indoor camera with just enough features to feel tech-savvy, the Blink Mini is a solid choice. It’s perfect for keeping an eye on pets, packages, or just giving your room a digital bouncer.Just keep in mind: it’s not built for video buffs or anyone hoping for multi-user access. For solo use? It’s a small but mighty helper.Read more"

This was 3 separate purchases within a few months.  All were handled expeditiously and arrived on time.  Installation of each was simple and straight forward.  The Wireless connection for each camera was accomplished easily with no problems outside of needing to purchase a WiFi extender to bring a wifi signal from the router to the other side of the house for the most distant camera to operate.Every camera operated perfectly and the pictures were unbelievably clear and detailed.I chose to not use the cloud storage but rather installed 256gb mini SD cards in the 3 outdoor cameras for recording any and all events.One problem developed after 4 months with 1 outdoor camera - there appeared an area on the picture that was blurry and could not be remedied by merely cleaning the lens - it seems there was an internal leak or something inside the lens that could not be cleared.  I contacted AOSU customer support and they could not have been more helpful.  After emailing them pictures of the installed camera and a still shot of the camera's picture showing the blur spot, they immediately sent me another brand new replacement camera.  I was amazed at how smooth, fast and simple they made this happen.AOSU is obviously an extremely reputable company that cares about their customers.

It would've been a five star product for me but for one issue: after ten months of consistently great daily use, my unit lost it's wifi connection and would not reconnect. (My friend with the other Aosu cam has had absolutely no problems with her unit).  I called Aosu's customer service and they were very pleasant and eager to help. They sent me a replacement camera right away at no charge. Do read on, though, because it turned out it's other qualities more than made up for that issue!For the few days before the new Aosu arrived I ordered another camera, one that had higher Amazon ratings and cost more. (Zumimall). The wifi fail had somewhat shaken my faith in Aosu, and I wanted a backup in case the new Aosu came with any issues.Holy cow what a reality check! I used the Zumimall for three or four days. By the end of the first day I was dying for the new Aosu's arrival because I like it *vastly* more. Like, night and day difference between the two cameras.The Aosu offers easy quick setup. It's picture quality is very clear with good light balance and it's a snap to zoom in and out to see more detail.  The controls for panning it around the room are very fast and efficient. It has a good and simple timer schedule if you want it to operate only on specific days at specific times. ALL of it's aspects easily surpass the ease and quality of the other cam.The Aosu offers bells and whistles I don't need or use (event recording, cloud storage, motion detection, night view options....) all of which are great options to have on board.Based on the survey that came with my replacement Aosu, the company is quite serious about improving their cameras' capabilities still further. Best for me, it's clear that the company's aware of their pet monitoring customers; many of the survey questions were pet-alert specific.I *wish* I could give this product 5 stars; I'm very impressed with it's quality and with Aosu's great customer service. But I have to drop it down one for the loss of wifi on one of the two cameras. Having said that, I *still* recommend this camera enthusiastically.Read more"

The devioce often disconnected and  kept resetting....I replaced it with the Decko equivalent model. Sad because IMo the Blu rams unti actually looks etter, rotates better etc... but the decko unit WORKS.This is not the end though... I will keep the BR unit since i own it and will just keep it to see how it continues to degrade... or improve??? with time.The Decko unit is not without flaws.... but it works so much better. The night vision is better, the feed and controls work as well...i think the BR has better controls.. .but they do not / hardly work.2/14/23Still updating / getting whatever money I can out of these junks.Currently getting a lot of  ""oops device has disconnected"" messages when devices are literally right next to the wifi routers. and viewing device has excellent recption etc...The camera seems to restart randomly.. It loses connection and literally performs the self test in the middle of viewing.Using it to watch some baby animals and it freezes, picture cuts to black / app needs restarting and the camera movement crashes the whole app.it just gets ""better"" as time goes by... better meaning worse!!!!!!!update:oct2022:  At this point im just keeping it to update for other people...why not?

I wanted to check on m birds.. but couldnt as the little ""spinning circle"" just kept spinning.Voice / sound is poor... why even have it as an option?Sionce getting the deckop units several monts ago, this unit has failed and needed to be readded to the ap pseveral times... 3 times n a few months. The decko units thus far havent had an issue like that.For the price, this camera is good. It has a lot of features for $25...even if it cost more the amount of features would be impressive....The night vision, I'd say is excellent, I've tested the two side by side literally and the alerts are faster and instantaneous compared to Dekco brand cameras, and there a few features that IMO make Bluerams great.. .but really, that's all there is to say. the app is filled with non stop ads to subscribe to cloud services, you can only watch maybe 15 seconds of live video, the reaction to controls is incredibly slow and inaccurate, it takes forever to load visuals.... and it freezes etc.. as I type this i can see the little ""loading"" circle going and going.. .  When you get a notice that someone is potentially stealing your crap, you don;t want ot watch a 10?? second ad before you can view your cameras... Im not paying for cloud services yes, but I want to be able to see instantaneous feed... especially if I get a notice saying someone has appeared in my garage.... I understand they want to promote it but almost every time I check my camera or get a notice?Overall I am quite disappointed. I have since started switching over to Dekco brand camers. Although those are also far from flawless. Id say they at least perform  better and more reliably.  One big advantage the Bluerams has over the dekco is that you can use the app to switch what wifi the unit is using. thats good if you have several different networks to choose from.Overall though, that one big advantage does not make it the superior unit.... very disappointed with these units.  I have 3 of them and all 3 are the same. I also have the outdoor unit which was also disappointing. So far, for a similar price, the Decko units have performed well, have similar featuers, and have recently added more features that make it beeter than these... If you want my advice, get the Dekco units.Updat: 8/31/22 Looks like the units have stopped working and have all ""disconnected""  It looks liek I will need to manually add the cameras again.... The reason why I am keeping these two onboard as compared to just repalceing them with Decko units is 1. I paid for them 2. they are in areas that aren;t that important.So far the Deckos have been trouble free and they even updated the app which includes a manual light override, and a better 2 way ommunication option.The ad advertising seems to have gotten more annoying / often as they try to advertise to you to buy cloud space.Read more"

I can definitely recommend this camera. I have it mounted up high on a bookshelf overlooking my studio. It can see just about everything. I have audio alerts set to tell me if my dog starts barking or any noise is detected in the home, and it will also detect the presence of someone in the home. It occasionally picks up the cat wandering around, too, so if it can catch a little guy like him, you know it'll catch a person no problem. It was easy to set up, the app is super easy to use, and I've never had any connectivity problems. Video quality is great, and I love that it has tracking features as well. Great value for how much it costs! Just make sure you buy a nice microSD card to use with it and you're all set.Read more"

The one-touch privacy feature is helpful when using it for a home office and turning it off when you are there and using it when you are not in that space. Definitely recommended. I like it for images within a 15-foot range (single room, entryway, covered porch, etc) I recommend using with the Eufy Homebase 3 so that you can easily access the video history.  Pretty easy to set up and use. Sound quality is sufficient for what I need. This is a plug-in device. Battery life is not a relevant issue. I like it so much I've purchased several.Read more"

Fantastic resolution, easy to use and set up. I’m impressed with the night vision though there is some lag or ghosting. Can use alone and use a micro as card or hook into the home base 3 for storage of video which is what I did. WiFi connection with the E30 is stable with a small amount of lag. The only disappointment is I tried to mount it to the far wall of a room and the tilt won’t allow for being able to tilt enough to be able to look to the end of the room. Perhaps a different mounting bracket would allow an upright mount. I had to wind up placing it in a more obvious spot on my mantle. Overall I am very happy with this camera and feel more secure both when I’m at home and away.Read more"

Truthfully it was the software that got me hooked. I have 2 of their indoor pet/baby cams, 2 of their indoor/outdoor with lightbulb attachment on my back porch and 1 of their cameras with lights an siren. All of the cameras have incredible quality both daytime and night vision. There is a slight delay of like 3 seconds when watching live. The 2 indoor came with a free 1 yr subscription but the others didn't however I use a storage cards on all of them, it gathers probably a week before it starts recording over old videos. I love that I can program it to record everthing or very event (when the motion detector is set off) an go back an watch it easily with the choice to download and save. However, if someone decided to take the outdoor camera which has the storage card, I would lose all the videos unless you have a subscription which stores everything and is why most of my cameras are indoor but facing outdoors in all directions. But you will still get alert screen shots. I'm just going to get a 1 yr subscription on the other 3, it's around $90 a year for 3 cams. I don't like that the outside ones do not have lights and siren options. But the software is truly a breeze! I can watch all 5 at once in a gride view. I get alerts anytime their is a event with a choice to view the photo or watch the video. They all have two way communication however I've tried this and there is a delay, I'm not sure that it's the best feature on these cameras maybe I'm not doing it right. You can watch back videos in 2x speed. They also record audio very well. For around $70 I basically set up an entire security system in my home and I will never switch to another brand.Read more"

My other cameras that were half the price work better and the settings actually make sense and they explain things!

Nothing makes sense for how this is set up and it’s constantly disconnecting from my WiFi and the router is 5 feet away in the same room and there is no wall in between. Not sure about it being able to record anything at all because of the connection problems. I need it to watch my dogs. The alarm setting makes no sense at all. I contacted support so let’s see if I can get some answers. So far this thing doesn’t seem to be worth the money.

The tilt on this one is nice but I honestly keep it stationary most of the time so prefer the higher-quality stationary ones, but my use case is also on-demand monitoring and the space is small enough that the camera doesn't need to move. So if you've got other needs - security or a large space, this is likely a great choice. Just know that 1080 quality does start to look a little underwhelming over distance.Gonna copy/paste what I said about the other camera:The two-way communication is actually pretty awesome - for as small as it is the camera's mic pics up decent audio. I did find that if you're on the monitoring end and want to speak through the camera you should do so slowly and deliberately as it takes a half-second for the speaker on the camera to kick on and broadcast; it cuts you off a little so just make sure you enunciate. Night mode is neat but I never use it.I use this for on-demand monitoring rather than 24/7 security so I had to look up how to disable certain things (motion tracking boxes, automatic light/alarm, etc.) but all were, blessedly, able to be disabled. Other reviews said those settings sometimes mysteriously come back on but I haven't experienced it, but had this operational for only about 20 days now.Having had this installed for over two week I've had none of the problems others spoke about. App is surprisingly functional and stable. I wish there were a ""refresh"" button in it as I had to close it out and re-open a couple of times to catch up to a live feed, but other than that no big deal.I will say they REALLY like to push notifications, access to your device, and upsell their cloud service. You can always hit no, but the popups are recurrent - I've had several in the ~20 days of use so far, so likely every few days you'll be asked if you're *REALLY* sure you don't want to buy online storage.Cameras haven't disconnected at all. Again, had to restart the app a few times but they were never unavailable to me. Unless I got lucky with these units I'm guessing they ironed out the problems people were having and/or the issues folks experience are because the cameras are on the periphery of WiFi - these do take a lot of data and so a strong, consistent signal is necessary.If you're monitoring these remotely on cell signal, know you'll need a good 5G signal to get an uninterrupted live feed. If you're low on bars or busted down to LTE you'll get some chop, maybe serious chop, depending on how hairy your connection is. These are essentially like streaming Netflix so again strong, consistent data is key if you want a truly live monitor.All in all, for the price, I'm honestly blown away. They have to be making near-zero on the hardware and using cloud subscriptions to subsidize selling the units, which would explain the constant badgering to sign up. But in the end that just means I get a really serviceable entry-level camera for the cost of a nice lunch.Read more"

We use the cameras for our dog during the day.This camera is quite impressive for the price. Picture quality is excellent, and the motors are quiet when moving around, so they do not disturb or wake our dog. It was easy to set up: download the app, plug it in, scan the QR, follow the instructions, and voila! It is a lot smarter than what we're used to, so it required a little learning, but overall, it's a really nice little camera. We don't need to record, but a friend told us you can get a high GB SD card, so it can easily record and store your videos if required. Also, it is nice to be able to control the camera to turn to where we want to see, AND unlike SimpliSafe cameras, it hasn't disconnected randomly if we wanted to monitor for a long period. That was one of the pet peeves about SimpliSafe.Highly recommended for home monitoring. Definitely will be switching out SimpliSafe cameras to this.Read more"

Do note that the cable is a micro-USB 2.0, so pretty much an older charger from a smartphone will work just fine, however I do recommend you use the included cable since it was specifically designed with weatherproofing in mind.Just like other Wyze cameras, this one is almost a plug-n-play. All you really need to do beforehand is to download the Wyze app that's available in the Apple App Store or Google Play store and create an account if you don't have one. The app itself is self-explanatory and will walk you through the entire setup process.Once you're setup, you can see all the features.Some notable ones include:- 360-degree rotation- Pan-Tilt-Digital Zoom- Privacy Mode- Scan Mode- Time lapse- Colored Night Vision- Motion and Face detection-Speaker/Siren/MicrophoneAnd more passive features include:- Localized SD Card- Ceiling Mounting Solutions (1/4 Thread means it can be mounted to a tri-pod)- Weather-proofMy personal favorites are the Colored Night Vision and the Time Lapse. Colored Night Vision is especially my favorite as it mostly does away with dealing with black & white night security footage. This can be helpful if you need to look at special details when investigating using the Wyze, such as color of a vehicle, or the color of lights of a vehicle driving by (This was especially helpful when identifying emergency vehicles).Time Lapse was another favorite as you can dictate the time span of how long you want to record a session. This was especially helpful for me when using the camera as a fun camera that could be used when recording mass gatherings like a party or a convention.Video Quality is more of a even playing field. Its a 1080p camera, so you get the quality of 1080p footage. It is good quality, but there are so many other options of similar performance.Why 4-stars?For me to put it at four stars despite enjoying this product very much falls short of one thing: Limitations of the app.Unfortunately, if you want the full amazing experience if requires great software, but that great software is half-way locked behind a subscription. Now don't get me wrong, the subscription known as ""Cam Plus"" is actually a good deal at $2.99/month or $19.99/year (price based on the time this review came out), but I'm a big fan of not paying a subscription at all; personally I'd like that ~$3 to go to my next cup of coffee. Despite the limited experience of not buying a subscription, there's a reason why Wyze cameras became my go to security solution. It's COMPLETELY OPTIONAL.In its free version in the app, you go as basic as motion notifications and occasional few-second recordings just to get a general idea of what event is happening in your security camera, which is more than enough of features for me. Be aware that you will need a micro-SD card to help with recordings since cloud storage is very limited.The Final thing to discuss is... why bother looking at the V3 when the  V4 is already available? The V4 has all the features I mentioned above, but its newer, faster, has an upgrade from a 1080p sensor to 4k sensor, and is similarly priced. Might as well go for the latest model, but if you specifically wanted the (comparably) older security camera, the Pan V3 is my go-to.Read more"

Smart Pet Devices,"THIRDREALITY Zigbee Motion Sensor, Pet Friendly, Compatible with Home Assistant, SmartThings, Aeotec, Homey, Hubitat or Echo Devices with Built-in Zigbee Hub",19.,4.0,"1,617",https://us.amazon.com/dp/B08RRRWK6B,5.0,"December 12, 2023",5.0 out of 5 starsGREAT NO-FRILLS SENSOR-  35 second recovery time!,"UPDATED BELOWI picked this up for $15.99 and so far so good.  The sensor is about as small as it could possibly be and still fit two AAA batteries inside.  It paired right away via Zigbee with my Hubitat C-5 hub and no other configuration was required (but see the little quirk below in the update).  It does not have a tamper sensor.  The only data returned by the sensor are motion and battery level.  The coverage area is nice and wide and I was pleased to discover that the motion sensing recovery time is only about 35 seconds.  Why does this matter?I currently have six Bosch motion/temp sensors in various places and one of them is right outside my front door.  I happened to get those on some sort of weird flash sale for $30 each where they were normally about $90.  For $30 they are just fine, but they are large, take 4AA batteries, and most significantly have a MINIMUM three-minute recovery time in between motion sensing events.I use one of the Bosch sensors to alert me when one of my two dogs has returned from whatever adventures they were having outside.  They tend to do their own thing and one of them almost always comes back before the other one.  If they return more than three minutes apart then it's not problem and I get two separate alerts for the two different dogs and can open the door twice.  But if the second dog comes back during the three-minute window right after the first, the Bosch motion sensor won't pick up the new motion alert and the second dog will be forced to wait outside with no recognition from his owner.No big deal right?  He just has to wait another three minutes.  Well, no.  If you are within the three-minute recovery period and the sensor is tripped again, it starts a NEW three-minute recovery period.  Assuming the dog doesn't freeze to death and keeps moving at some point during that three-minute period, the sensor will just keep re-tripping and going into an endless loop of three-minute recovery periods until the dog finally freezes or dehydrates.  Thus the dilemma.With the 35-second recovery period of this sensor, I have now reduced the potential mortality rate of my second dog to return home by a factor of five.  Good progress.UPDATE:  The first sensor continues to work great a month later.  I bought two more via the two-pack deal.  The first one paired up instantly with zero issues.  The second one paired up fine but came up as (blank) for the device type (Hubitat C-5 hub) and very strangely showed ""Signify NV"" as the manufacturer instead of ThirdReality.  I tried changing the device type manually to ""Generic Zigbee motion sensor- no temp,"" which is what the other two sensors automatically configured as.  The sensor would show up as a device in my Hubitat device list but would not report any data.  I removed it, did a factory reset, re-added, repeated, and still had the same problem.  Posted a question here to see if there was a firmware update.Before I gave up, I tried one last thing that I had zero expectation of working.  I removed the device again from Hubitat, held down the reset button and did a factory reset, and then took the batteries out.  While holding down the reset button, I put the batteries back in and did one more reset.  I have no idea why or how, but this somehow fixed the issue.  The sensor paired up no problem with Hubitat, configured as ""Generic Zigbee motion sensor- no temp"" and properly showed ""ThirdReality"" as the manufacturer.  From there on out the sensor worked just fine.  I can't explain it but if you have the same weird problem I did, try doing a couple factory resets and holding down the button while taking the batteries out and then putting them back in.  LOL the mysteries of the universe.Read more"

And let me tell you, these THIRDREALITY Zigbee Motion Sensors have become my absolute go-to for my motion automation needs. I pretty much stalk them, waiting for sales to stock up, and I have them strategically placed all over my house.What really makes these sensors shine, especially for Home Assistant users, is their rock-solid compatibility. They pair effortlessly with my Zigbee coordinator (using ZHA, of course!), and their responsiveness is fantastic. I've set up automations for lights turning on when I enter a room, fans activating, and even security alerts, and these sensors trigger them without a hitch. It's truly a ""set it and forget it"" experience, which is exactly what you want when building a smart home.Plus, the battery life on these things is phenomenal. I'm talking months, if not over a year, before I even need to think about replacing the AAAs. No more constantly swapping out those tiny, expensive coin cell batteries from other brands!Pros:* Flawless Home Assistant Integration: Pairs easily and works reliably with ZHA and Zigbee2MQTT.* Excellent Battery Life: Seriously, the AAA batteries last an incredibly long time, saving you hassle and money.* Reliable Motion Detection: Quick and accurate triggers for your automations.* Pet-Friendly: Designed to minimize false alerts from your furry friends, which is a huge bonus!* Good Value: Especially when you grab them on sale, they're a cost-effective way to blanket your home with motion detection.* OTA Firmware Updates: The ability to update firmware through Home Assistant is a nice touch, ensuring long-term compatibility and potential improvements.Cons:* No Temperature/Illuminance Sensor: Unlike some other motion sensors on the market, these are purely motion detectors. If you need additional data, you'll need separate sensors.* Rectangular Form Factor: While unobtrusive, some might prefer a smaller or rounder design for certain placements.Overall, if you're diving deep into Home Assistant or any other Zigbee-compatible smart home hub, you simply cannot go wrong with the THIRDREALITY Zigbee Motion Sensors. They're a fantastic, reliable, and affordable choice that will truly elevate your home automation game.Read more"

Frustrating garbage.,Complete garbage. Got 1 of 2 connected pretty quickly and everything was looking good.  But after about 48 hours everything went south. One became unreachable.  So I reconnected it but regardless both stopped working on my zigbee network.  So hours and hours of trying to disconnect and reconnect I just gave up and will now buy another brand.  Such promise but these are cheaply made and my guess is they couldn't handle 50 degree F garage temps.  So maybe this would work better inside a heated space. Just guessing as I could no longer handle the frustration.Update:I'm new at zigbee.  I didn't realize these motion sensors are end points and not repeaters.  I spend another $100 on some 3 way switches and installed them in between my controller and the sensors.  Now one is green and one yellow but everything is working well now and I'm happy.  It's important to realize these are not nearly as powerful as wifi.  So you will need mains powered repeaters like switches in between.  I've been feeling out big time and have now spent $250 just to get my garage lights to turn on and start on with motion.  But it's sort of a hobby now and I've found more cool use cases like using an outdoor motion sensor to use an outdoor camera to snap a picture of my driveway and front door and text it email it and send me a telegram.  My wife can get it too but she doesn't care about it as much as I do.  I like to have evidence of my deliveries etc.  I had to use grok extensively to figure out how to get it to work.So I'm a happy camper but you best be ready to make this a full time job for a week or two.I also now have a water sensor next to my water heater that will beep and text me an alert if it defects water. Super cool!Read more

The configuration is easy in the app, but it does take some time as you have to input and limit it's effective range of sensing movement and presence. Thankfully the app screen is easy to read and interpret during the configuration process. I have it so the lights can change color at specific times of the day depending on the presence in a room. Some things to be mindful of: it has to remain plugged in; it seems to only command Govee products ( I use google home and it just says if someone is present or not); it will take a few seconds to register that a person is in a room so it isn't as fast as a dedicated PIR sensor.Hover makes good stuff - especially their lights - so I'd light to get more to make my house even smarter.

The picture quality is fantastic on both light and dark settings. The cord is long enough to get to the outlets near the floor and the setup was SO easy. We tried another camera that literally took us 30 minutes to sort out the setup and it was terrible. No these!

They are very reasonably priced and I was afraid they wouldn’t be of good quality.  I was wrong.  The pictures are clear, the colors are crisp. The app is easy to use and has many useful functions and options for settings.  The whole set up of cameras and app took about 5 minutes each.  They are very responsive to movement and sound and you can adjust the sensitivity.  I like that you can set a “detection zone” if you want to cut down on extraneous detections, so instead of monitoring the entire front yard I can just set it to detect if someone actually comes onto my porch if I want. I like that I can also hear what’s outside when in the live mode (and speak to someone outside). The siren, microphone and spotlight work very well.  You can set it to make an audible “WYZE” tone outside if it detects someone OR to let them know they are being recorded.  I actually have a couple of mine sitting on outside window ledges with the cord coming in under the window to plug in.  The cords are flat so it works.  The others are mounted outside near outlets and they came with what you need to mount them.  I’m not paying for the iCloud storage for the videos because I don’t need it.  And since I’m not doing the advanced monitoring there are functions that I don’t get. But that is ok for me right now.  Overall, I’m very happy with them.  Considering getting one more.  You can look back through the recording and they are marked where there were sound/movement detections.  My only negative is that you can look back at the video on the app in 30 second increments rather than actually “scrolling” so you could miss something that wasn’t detected.  If I take the SIM card out and put it in my laptop I can do more of a “scroll”.  I have had a few episodes of verified movements that weren’t detected/notified/marked on the video but nothing big.  That aside, I highly recommend. And I’ll add that 10 days after getting these one of my cameras recorded a neighbor’s trailer being stolen.  So while I didn’t have the alarm/notification set to go off overnight on that particular camera I was able to give them the footage which they say has been helpful.Read more"

The network connection on these also seems to be faster and more stable than the V2/V3 cams.  I have a prosumer home Wifi setup (Ubiquiti) and I've had to tinker to get the WiFi good with some of the other cams, not so with the OG cams, they just work and have a strong performance.The sound and microphone quality seems just as good as the other cameras, which is to say serviceable.  The detection accuracy seems improved compared to the older cams.The Spotlight feature seems a little inconsistent at times, but I don't care, I didn't buy these cameras for that functionality.  I have other sensors and bulbs in my home automation ecosystem that handle that functionality.I think these are the best value cams in the Wyze line currently.  I'm really happy with them.

I couldn't get a new 1st Gen, so I got this one. It was easy to set up the first time and hook up to my existing Google Home. It worked fine the first day or so. Then, a few days later, following a power outage, it said it needed to be hooked up to the Google Home app. I couldn't get this to work without doing a factory reset. and it took days to have time to find the instructions. I got it hooked up and it worked for another day or two. It had been unplugged, so I thought that was the issue. After doing another factory reset and hooking it up again, we were very careful to avoid power outages, but it again stopped working soon after an unknown number of days (hadn't used it for some time). Did the factory reset, and now it spoke Japanese until we got it hooked up. As it was past the 30 day window, we couldn't return it. Have reset once or twice since then, hoping to get it to work, but it never stays more than a day or two. I love our other two, or I'd already be replacing all with Amazon Echo Speakers. As it is, we're replacing this with one, and will do the same should the others fail.Read more"

The box is labelled all in Japanese, and when you first plug in the unit it speaks in Japanese.  Once you connect to your Google Home app, it speaks in whatever language that is configured for.  Installation is not as easy as expected, before you can connect to Google home you must download and run the Device Utility app.  I'm disappointed by this as I would have expected a Google product to be configured to work directly with the Google home app.  Once up and running, the Google assistant works well and the sound quality is very good for such a small speaker.Read more"

(look below to see why I bought a second, or just get one already).It does what it says, it does it well, and at a reasonable price.Now for the audio nerds out there...  So, I can stream directly to my receiver using its built-in AirPlay2.  It sounds fine,  And I know that it's better to get lossless data directly into my external DAC,  which sounds way better than the DACs built-in to my receiver.  But for convenience, nothing beats AirPlay streaming to the WiiM Mini, which connects to my external DAC via Optical.  Does it sound as good as a direct connection to the DAC (no AirPlay AAC shenanigans involved)?  No, it does not.  But it definitely sounds WAY better than streaming AirPlay to my receiver's DACs, and so much more convenient than direct-connecting to the DAC.When I want to do attentive listening, I use an iPad connected via USB-C to the USB input of the Denafrips.  When I just want to hear the Denafrips as part of my whole-house sound, the WiiM mini is my first choice.Looks like the internal DACs on my receiver are now relegated to Home Theater.The Mini is super easy to set up, it inhabits my AirPlay whole-house sound system beautifully, and the app even has some nice music discovery features of its own.  This morning my ""alarm clock"" automation went off.  It played SomaFM in my bedroom, and in the Home Theater through the Mini and into my external DAC.  I made coffee, and spent a little time in from of the home theater/Denafrips system and thought...  ""yep, that sounds nice"". That's all I was after, and that's exactly what I got.  Nice job WiiM.I may get a couple more Minis before they introduce a new model that doesn't have AirPlay2 (I know, they're only rumors).== UPDATE ==So yes, I just bought my second WiiM Mini, and this time it's to run a second zone in my house as part of an AirPlay setup.My AVR has two zones, and I was using the AVR for that, but it's nowhere near as convenient as having another AirPlay device.  However, I want better sound than I can get from a HomePod, and I have in-wall speakers that I want to use.In-wall speakers sound better than a HomePod?  Well, if they're decent and driven by a decent zone amp (I'm looking at you Parasound ZAmp), and you use the WiiM Room Correction feature, then YES, it's not even close.The Room Correction feature worked so well in my setup that my in-wall speakers in the dining room actually sound very good now.  Like not just good, but very good (not mindblowing either, but I'll take very good for this application).So yeah, the Mini has shown itself to be a great little swiss army knife and that's just using the AirPlay capability.WiiM Mini with Room Correction is killer.Read more"
Voice Assistants,"WiiM Mini AirPlay 2 Wireless Audio Streamer, Multiroom Stereo, Preamplifier, Works with Alexa and Siri Voice Assistants, Stream Hi-Res Audio from Amazon Music, Tidal and More",89.,4.4,"4,482",https://us.amazon.com/dp/B09HC5GRKY,5.0,"June 30, 2022","5.0 out of 5 starsProbably best, cheapest Amazon Music HD/HUD solution.","If you use SPDIF instead of internal Dac, this little device would let you forget about the expensive BlueSound Node, the troublesome and unstable raspberry pi runs on any OS. This is simply the easiest and best solution by far.  The downside would be that it uses it's own app to log into all the music services. You won't be able to browse through the native APP UI from spotify, tidal, qobuz or even amazon music.I haven't tried gapless so I can't put down ""it just works"" stamp yet! However, hi-res does work as expected.  There are some glitches and bugs from Amazon Music though.  When comparing to Qobuz, it simply just works as bit perfect.  On the Amazon Music HD/UHD I believed it's probably Amazon's fault here.  There will be constrain on bitrate and sampling rate if you output from TV because it's running mostly Android OS (ye! I am looking at you Amazon FireTV 4k Stick). You will only get 48k.  However, on the Wiim mini is another story. It's better to show 24bit, but sometimes it's not bit perfect. it doesn't always shows properly up to 192k.Due to the inconsistency of Amazon music. Depends on your Dac, your streamer box (a computer, an iphone, tv, or wiim mini) they all behave differently. I can't grasp which one is the ""best"" solution or claim to be bit perfect here.  But Amazon music seems to output hi-res music for sure. Amazon still need to work on their device compatibility issues though.For qobuz, it works like a breeze.  Always accurate, and always works! I've had raspberry pi ran through LMS, volumio, audirvana, and roon before.  If you want me to choose what's the best solution for sound quality and simplicity, I would choose wiim mini.Although you don't have a roon or audirvana as centralized server. You can't ""stream"" music to every devices from a home server. You will lose ""screen display"" feature on your computer or tv.  However, you will not bump into audirvana can't switch playback devices or roon constantly having server down issues you need to restart the server.  Best of all, you don't need to deal with LMS or volumio just another update that something ""doesn't work"" again.For the sound quality, I compare to Qobuz, it is indeed a close match.  To be easy to use and bit perfect, Qobuz is obviously the best choice. Amazon music comes in second with this wiim mini.Best of all was the Alexa integration.  It's now possible to tell Alexa to play music, and on wiim mini side, it starts to play bit perfect hi-res music. That's simply the missing piece from the echo eco system that Amazon did not have on their own products unless you've gone for Echo Studio. Amazon really need to do some catch up.It will sound better than you use Amazon FireTV 4k Sticks plug into the AVR before TV. Due to ""compatibility"" issues, versions of FireTV OS, and FireTV hardware. Not all FireTV works right out of box. In addition, not all AVR works with FireTV stick either. So I am grateful that Wiim Mini simply skips that whole route all together.The weak link would be spotify connect (not very sure if spotify connect is ever going to support bit perfect when spotify finally release hi res audio). Tidal works okay but obviously your DAC needs to decode MQA because wiim mini can't do that from internal DAC.  Best experiences comes from Qobuz and Amazon Music HD/UHD. Bluetooth was alright.  When you can stream through WIFI, why bother with Bluetooth?However, the streaming service is very limited. It won't support even something like Pandora just yet! You really need to use Airplay2 to playback those type of music services.Read more"

Partiamo dalla confezione:1. Nella scatola, compatta, c'è tutto quello che serve. Alimentatore, cavo usb C, cavetti di collegamento analogici e persino il cavo ottico per un DAC esterno.2. Il dispositivo è piccolissimo, può trovare posto ovunque. Ha i controlli fisici del volume e un tasto play/pausa. Molto comodo.3. App WiiM Home, scaricata dal Play Store. Di immediato utilizzo, con una procedura guidata consente la connessione alla rete WiFi e in due minuti il dispositivo è pronto per essere utilizzato. Dall'app si possono gestire molti settaggi, compresa l'equalizzazione; sono direttamente accessibili tutti i servizi di streaming (quando dico tutti intendo tutti, sono supportati veramente una moltitudine). Si può configurare l'uscita in maniera tale che sia bit perfect, si può abilitare il Bluetooth, si hanno le informazioni della qualità dello streaming in tempo reale. Notevole.4. Compatibilità software. Il WiiM è abilitato Spotify connect, quindi è gestibile direttamente dall'app di Spotify. Alexa lo riconosce facilmente, per cui è molto semplice inserirlo in gruppi di altoparlanti anche insieme ai vari Echo Dot e simili, da cui si può comandarlo con controllo vocale. Interessante il fatto che l'app Amazon Music lo veda come altoparlante e consenta direttamente lo streaming. Con Airplay qualsiasi dispositivo Apple può inviare l'audio al WiiM, funzione che purtroppo non esiste su Android (l'unica alternativa è Google cast che però sul mini non c'è, bisogna andare sul WiiM pro). Non ho Tidal o Quobuz, ma dalle altre recensioni direi che funzionino bene. Ho provato dei brani ad alta risoluzione dal cellulare e sono andati perfettamente.5. Suono ed esperienza d'uso. Ho connesso il WiiM solo con l'uscita ottica, sia al mio ampli (un buon Marantz), sia a un DAC Topping che utilizzo per l'ascolto in cuffia insieme a un ampli Atom. Tutto perfetto, connessione sempre stabilissima. Comodo il fatto che il volume sia controllabile dalle App, ma per chi vuole essere sicuro di avere un segnale bit perfect, ossia senza alcuna modifica rispetto all'originale, è possibile impostare l'uscita a volume fisso (ovviamente è anche necessario disabilitare l'equalizzatore). Il suono dipende quindi da tutta la catena, non tanto dal WiiM: il consiglio è quello di usare un DAC esterno e godersi la musica digitale. Da recensioni specializzate il DAC interno è discreto ma niente di più, quindi meglio evitare.6. Conclusioni. Il WiiM è uno streamer ottimo, economico soprattutto se preso in offerta, molto flessibile, ben supportato (App e firmware sono in costante sviluppo), con qualità audio altissima se collegato a un buon DAC, e soprattutto divertente da utilizzare. Gli manca solo il protocollo Google cast, ma se dovesse servire i dispositivi WiiM più costosi ne sono dotati.Consiglio l'acquisto senza riserve.AGGIORNAMENTOPurtroppo, dopo l'entusiasmo iniziale, capita molto di frequente che il dispositivo non venga più rilevato, né dall'app WiiM né da Spotify. A questo punto è necessario resettare tutto, riconfigurare, e normalmente l'operazione va fatta più di una volta. Al momento non riesce più e connettersi alla rete a 5 GHz, chissà perché. La cosa è faticosa e ho voglia di restituire il dispositivo, che ha grandi potenzialità ma è inaffidabile (ho il sospetto che dipenda da qualche aggiornamento firmware, mi era capitato una volta, poi a un certo punto sembrava risolto, e adesso va ancora peggio). Peccato. Non consiglio più l'acquisto.SECONDO AGGIORNAMENTOProblema risolto, i malfunzionamenti erano dovuti all'alimentatore. Dopo averlo sostituito è magicamente tornato tutto a funzionare. E sono di nuovo 5 stelle!Read more"

This speaker is by far the best home speaker I have ever owned. The sound quality is wonderful. I'm so happy that it has both Google assistant and Alexa built into it. I think more manufacturers of home speakers should do the same. I like the retro styling and the build quality of the speaker is excellent. The only downside I can think of is the price point. I think it's kind of an expensive speaker but you do get a lot for what you pay for in this speaker. I'm glad that there's an Ethernet port because ethernet is faster than Wi-Fi. It also has a USB type-c port for connecting MP3 players. This speaker also comes with all the cables needed, like a USB type-c to USB type-c cable and a 3.5 cable. It also comes with a ethernet cable.For clarification, the JBL authentics 200 is a 90 w speaker. I know Amazon indicates that it's a 200 w speaker but this is not correct.

I run some serious hardware from meze elite epoque headphones to legacy signature speakers. I say all this to give a bit of credit to my background on sound and knowing where a good set of transducers can take you.I recently changed my bedroom audio setup to move my floor standing speakers (old wharfedale diamond 9.5's) to acomidate my tv. This had the drawback of removing them from my echo and I needed a solution to provide the room with ""good enough"" audio that the little echo just could not muster. So I started my search for a new all in one voice assistant but did not want a second set of tower speakers in the room so I looked at the usual suspects. The echo studio, sonos, etc but none of them had what I was looking for when it came to sound quality. Enter the jbl 500 it was not on my radar at all but I stumbled across it in my searching. It had mixed reviews with an emphasis on the size of the speaker. Now for me coming from a set of tower speakers size was not the limiting factor. So I ordered one and had it at my door in no time at all. This guy was well packed and had a good presentation my only complaint is that the bass driver is exposed and you have to be cognizant not to put a finger through it as you lift it out of the box. This speaker has a good amount of weight for its size and feels well built. Physical setup is a breeze with one power cable and you are done. After that you need the app which is not the best but definitely not the worst I have used. In the app you will connect it to your wifi and then setup your voice assistants. This guy supports both google and alexa with the former being very easy to setup and the latter being a oddity. The google setup punched right in like any other google home device and setup was a breeze. The alexa app on the other hand just opened to a spinning circle with no errors. After contacting tech support I tried everything under the sun to get it to take and somewhere along the line fixed it. I am not sure if it was a wifi bug or just needed to run in for some time but after I tried the next day everything popped right in no problem.Now on to the sound... good golly this was not what I was expecting! This guy goes to show what modern tech has brought to the table vs my older diamond speakers. I started it on some tash music because I was not expecting much from this guy but what came belting out from this box was clean powerful sound. My first stop was ""the used - in love and death"" and there it was a musical tonality that I would described as playful or V shaped. The bass was plentiful but not overwhelming, solidly in the fun category but not drifting into bloated or slow territory. In short it sounded good, darn good... better than it had rights to sound given its size. So intrigued I switched from background music to my analytical music section to see if this was some kind of fluke. I popped on one of my favorites the live copy of ""Fink - troubles what you are in"" and gave this speaker my full attention. This speaker did not shirk from my critical ear as the acoustic guitar was crisp and you could distinctly pick out the difference between the sounds of his palm on the wood vs the cajon. I was gobsmacked, baffled, dare I say impressed. I tossed the kitchen sink of all the greats (steely dan, daftpunk, pinkfloyd, etc) at this box and it continued to impress. I was left wondering if I toss the diamonds in favor of picking up another one of these it is THAT GOOD. The fact that a single six inch driver could come even close to the range that four drivers of the same size is witchcraft.I love the sound profile that this uses with the heavy V shape. To me this is one of my favorites as it sets the toes a tapping and head a bobbing more than that holy grale flat profile. I would compare this to the fiio FH9 as something that I turn on and go ""that sounds right"" no tweaking or changes it just sounds like my ideal of what I want from music.If you made it this far into the review I commend you! If you just scrolled to the end for the TLDR buy it you wont be dissapointed.Read more"

I like that I was able to get it in blue instead of black, but it would be nice to see more color options. Thled power indicator is a very nice touch and it is easily visible day or night. The flashing LEDs on the sides a a playful feature, but I wonder how significant their impact on battery life is. Love the shoulder strap, it makes mobility a breeze. Sound is powerful enough for just about any space I would use it in, and the quality of the sound is good at this point. Not sure if it's jume, but I but I don't really care for the way the controls are labeled and the volume control feels reversed to me.

I'm using the WiiM Home App or alternatively the Tidal Connect link using Tidal's app.  The WiiM unfolds MQA on Tidal for a perceptibly clearer and more dynamic sound.  The WiiM Pro Plus sits on a shelf above my dedicated headphone amplifier -- a Schist Ragnarok -- and plays music through a set of Audeze LCD-2 headphones that I've had for years.  I'm using my iPad as a control device (either the WiiM Home app or Tidal app) while I do actual work on my iMac.I've only had this for a couple of days, so I don't have anything to say about reliabiiity or long-term listening fatigue.  I CAN say that I'm finding the sound quality much better than I feared.  My primary listening system uses very high-quality audiophile gear that I've painstakingly acquired to achieve great sound.  The DAC alone is more than 10 times more expensive than the WiiM, and my electrostatic speakers are over $10,000 these days.  So I'm used to good sound.  That said, the WiiM Pro Plus is a simply OUTSTANDING deal.  I'm not doing any critical listening, but I'm quite happy with my new office music partner.Setup was trivial, although the instructions were either too simple or too complex.  The only quick-setup guide was for the hand-held remote, and that's sending me to a device menu buried in the user interface.  The full 40-page manual can be downloaded, and poking around will reveal the performance, hook-up, and features that are quite impressive (10-band equalizer, for instance, or the ability to sync multiple units together for whole-house sound, as examples).  For my super-simple office application it was major overkill.I use Roon at home, and Tidal.  The WiiM Home App works mostly intuitively, although there are a lot of features and capabilities that might be important to those who like to play with their food rather than just eat it.  There are a lot of ways to use this streamer, including as a simple streamer into a DAC of your choice if you don't like the built-in upgraded AKC DAC that is the ""Plus"" part of the WiiM Pro Plus package.At the moment this is not ""Roon-Ready""  but the previous experience with the WiiM Pro model suggests that it should become RAAT certified in a couple months or so.  The WiiM shows up on my Roon app as a Squeezebox Lite unit, which is better-sounding than Chromecast or Airplay.  I've tried mine with 3 different control maps:  1) the WiiM App, which you need to run at least occasionally to keep track of over-the-air updates (I've had 3 so far and I've had it less than a week).  2) Tidal Connect let's you cast your phone Tidal through the WiiM where it will connect to your account and run the highest bit-rate supported, depending on what your Tidal plan supports.  I'm using the top plan and the high-res + MQA sound quality is best so far.  3)  You can run it as a Roon end point player, although not yet certified.  When it does get certified, that is likely to be the best-sounding option, giving you the most control of your music.The WiiM app purportedly lets you play your own music if you have it online in your network someplace.  I tried linking one of my music folders and it kinda worked, but got very draggy and slow.  It's like teaching a dog to dance...  it's amazing it can do that, much less do it well.Overall I'm very pleased with my purchase, the great development team behind it and the terrific value it represents in terms of sound quality and capabilities at this price point.  Highly recommended.Read more"

""most of the time""","Rarely do I get a affordable piece of audio gear that truly impresses me, but all the hype about this streamer/DAC is true.Pros:Ease of setup - Your grandmother could have this up and running in no time.Software (app/firmware) - Well designed app to manage the streamer and Wiim actively updates the firmware so it appears they have a team of devs (70+ I've heard) making improvements and addressing bugs. ""Always a good sign"".Sound - Now if you have a $2000 DAC in your system this probably isn't going to impress you, but for a $200 streamer/DAC you'll find this not far behind. Rich, detailed performance with reasonably good soundstage. I actually like DAC in this model over the Wiim Ultra. (a matter of taste) If you are just looking for a streamer/DAC and don't need the extra features the Ultra has, save the money and get this model.Price - I challenge you to find a streamer/DAC that sounds this awesome for $200 new. If you find one, shoot me an email.Con: It has a problem (at least on the two that I have) of loosing connection to the app if you have an unexpected power outage. When the streamer comes back up, it can be found by the app. Not only that, you'll have to go through the setup process again to get it working again.Suggedtions: If you know who to set a static IP address on the router, do so and set a static (Manual) IP address on the streamer. Disable IPv6 and set the ""Standby"" to ""Never"". The one additional step I took was to connect the power to a uninterruptable power supply. That took care of my power ""blip"" issue.Wiim has been super hyped with their line of surprisingly affordable gear. I don't think you'll go wrong with any of their recent offerings and the Pro Plus certainly qualifies.Read more"

Definitely happy with the purchase.There is one thing that disappointed me a bit though… when using an HDMI cable, you can control the volume on the sound bar with the TV remote instead of having to use the included Bose remote.Unfortunately, when trying to take advantage of this feature, there is quite a bit of lag. When trying to turn up the volume, you’ll hit the button once or twice and nothing will happen. Then all of a sudden your volume goes from a quarter of the way up to almost full blast. And it’s just as wacky trying to get the volume turned back down again. I have a Sony Bravia TV that’s only about a year and a half old so I doubt that is the issue and I tried multiple brand new cables to make sure that that wasn’t causing it. I think it’s just the time that it takes the sound bar to respond to the TV input.Like I said, it is a bummer but the sound quality is amazing. I just switched to an optical audio cable and am dealing with having multiple remotes.If I knew of another product that was actually responsive with the regular TV remote, I would probably return this and go that route, but I don’t want to be buying and returning sound bars for the rest of my life. I’m blessed to have a problem as small as using two remotes instead of one.Read more"

I love that it has top-facing speaker grilles, which allow the sound to project upward. Other, more expensive bars often have a glass surface on top, which limits vertical sound projection. With this one, sound flows forward, sideways, upward, and backward—creating a fully immersive experience.I later added the Bose Bass Module 500 via wired connection, and the improvement in low-end response was immediate. However, even without the subwoofer, the soundbar performs very well when watching Dolby Atmos content.Using your TV’s eARC port is key. In my setup, I connected the Apple TV to HDMI 1 and the soundbar to HDMI 2 (eARC) on my 70” LG QNED TV. Proper configuration avoids annoying black screen flickers while the system negotiates the audio format. I recommend disabling Apple TV’s automatic frame rate and dynamic range switching, and on the LG TV, setting the audio output to “passthrough” instead of “auto.”Finally, adding the Bose Surround Speakers 300 (also applies to the 700s) takes the system to a whole new level. In my large, closed room, you can truly feel effects surround you—like a bullet whizzing past your right ear. Just amazing.Read more"

I have always been a fan of BOSE for the sounddock systems and the portable battery powered Revolve +. Bose is known for over emphasized & artificially created soundstage. However, this in my opinion is a positive when it comes to small portable speakers. When the first BOSE sounddock came out years ago I was amazed at how big and full it sounded for it's size. I have had a few generations of that one and now they have the Bose Soundtouch 10,20,30 series. I own the series 20 and have it at my office. Great smaller hardwired speaker. However, I wanted a portable speaker to take to the beach, pool, my garage, our back porch, yard, etc. The answer was the BOSE Revolve Plus. First time I powered it on I was amazed at the sound and bass for the little size. The battery lasts a long time and being splash proof was nice when we would take to our friends pool. With our growing family I find the revolver plus disappearing more so I was looking to purchase another. I waited a few weeks knowing BOSE was coming out with the newer version that was only slightly bigger, more powerful, deeper bass, WiFi AND now with Alexa and other app capability. I received it about a week ago and it was very easy to hook up to internet, update and run the BOSE app. No issues like some others have had. I really enjoy being able to run it on WiFi at home, but still be able to use Bluetooth if out and about.  I think the Sonos app is better, but the Bose app is still ok and seems to get better with updates. (Been using the BOSE app a few years now) After charging, I set it side by side with Revolver plus to see if it was different enough or if I would be sending back for another Revolver plus. I could easily flip back and forth in my Spotify app to move the sound instantly from one back to the other over and over. Tried different genres of music from Country, to Hip Hop to Jazz to Rock. Definitely a warmer and more filling sound with the new BOSE Portable Home Speaker. Louder as well if needed. I thought the Revolver had great sound, but now it sounds a little flatter next to this one. The extra radiator gives a little more bass too which is nice. The size between the two is almost the same with the new Bose being a hair taller and wider and a tad heavier. I have a pic of both above side by side. I skipped the Sonos Move, not because of sound, but its size, weight and portability. No way are you throwing that speaker in a suitcase or car to travel. Much heavier and much bigger in size. The size of this speaker and grab handle make it excellent for taking anywhere with you. Add the built-in Alexa and you get a great speaker. Yes, it is a tad pricey. If you are considering the Revolve plus, spend the extra $50 for this one. You won't be sorry. Overall I am very satisfied with this speaker. Very clear highs, ""ok"" mid-range and decent bass for the size. I also like you can adjust the bass and treble on this one where the Revolve you cannot. I currently own a Sonos Play 5, which I love and use in my family room. I also own a Sonos Beam for a center in the family room. Both are great for that room and I really like the Sonos app. I also have a Martin Logan theater system in the basement.  This Bose is honestly not that far behind the Play 5 which is mind boggling. Just shows you what a great job BOSE can do with such a tiny footprint. To sum up, if you want a portable speaker that you can actually take with you easily to the beach, pool, yard, gym or anywhere, I don't think this speaker will disappoint for the size, sound, Alexa capability and battery life. Well done BOSE!Read more"

You will not regret this purchase.,"This speaker is just amazing. I've had this for a few months now, and since it's sitting next to me on my desk, I felt compelled to share a review. I previously owned the Bose Soundlink II (also awesome, but no Alexa of course) as well as a host of other less expensive portable speakers.- Sound Quality: As expected from Bose, the sound quality of this speaker is exceptional at any volume level. Friends are consistently amazed at the sound quality, especially considering the small footprint and portability. Crisp highs, deep but not overly boomy lows, and you have access to EQ settings in the Bose App, which also works well.- Portability: The carry handle is great and the charging dock is extremely convenient and sturdily constructed. I also purchased an awesome carrying case for under $20 which is incredibly nice - the Khanka Hard Travel Case Replacement for Bose Portable Home Bluetooth Speaker (Fits Charging Cradle)- Battery life: I've experienced 8+ hours of constant play time. Just remember to turn it all the way off before putting it in the case for travel, or it will likely be low or dead when you take it out. (Although this isn't an issue if you have access to AC power and a USB-C cable)The voice control mics are also very sensitive as advertised, which is great. You can be listening to music LOUD in another room, and the speaker will still respond to Alexa commands.Another exceptional Bose product, and the Alexa integration makes it so convenient to use! 6 stars.Read more"
Voice Assistants,"Bose Portable Smart Speaker — Wireless Bluetooth Speaker with Alexa Voice Control Built-in, Silver",399.,4.3,"3,725",https://us.amazon.com/dp/B07VFKBQ3G,4.0,"December 20, 2023",4.0 out of 5 starsGreat but probably a little overpriced,"I'll compare the Bose Portable Smart Speaker with the Amazon Echo Studio, as they seem quite similar, and I own both.Firstly, the most important feature: sound quality. Both speakers excel in their own ways. The Bose delivers richer sound with deeper bass, while the Amazon Echo Studio offers clearer treble and better room-filling capabilities, maintaining consistent volume throughout the space. In terms of sound, I would rate them about equally; both are impressive, and I believe the average listener would be satisfied with either.Regarding voice assistants, both speakers have no trouble picking up my voice, even from across the room with music playing. However, I give the Bose an extra point as it is compatible with both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, offering more flexibility in voice assistant choice.Ease of use is where the Amazon Echo excels; it's almost a plug-and-play experience. It connects to Wi-Fi effortlessly and is ready to go right out of the box. The Bose, although excellent once set up, requires more effort initially. I encountered difficulties connecting it to the Bose app and had to attempt several times before it recognized the speaker. Furthermore, signing into my Bose and then my Amazon account for the voice assistant functionality was a bit cumbersome. Bose could improve its user-friendliness in this regard.Feature-wise, the Bose takes the lead. Its compact size and battery operation give it an edge over the Amazon Echo, which must remain plugged in. The Bose's portability is a significant advantage, although I dislike that its charging dock is sold separately, especially considering the speaker's high price.Speaking of price, the Echo wins here; it's half the cost of the Bose. My biggest gripe with the Bose is its price. Although it's a premium speaker, $400 seems steep for its size. For the same price, you could acquire the Echo Studio plus the Echo Subwoofer and still save money, likely with superior sound. A more reasonable price for the Bose would be around $250, making it a more compelling choice. Unless you specifically need the Bose's portability, the Amazon Echo offers better value.Update: Well my cat knocked it off the counter top and it hit the hard wood floor hard. It put a small but barely noticeable dent in the speaker grill (I guess I could get the grill replaced if I really tried but the dent is so small that its not worth it) but other than that the speaker seems completely unharmed. Still sounds great. I wouldn't suggest dropping the thing on a regular basis but it is nice to know that it's built tough.Read more"

The link quality is handy as this lets you know if it has a good connection to the hub. I use this on my inside garage door. When I come home and open that door, I have an automation event that turns on the hallway lights. I only turn on the lights if I enter the home, not when I leave. I use a motion sensor in the hallway to detect that I am approaching the door from the inside. The automation will not turn on the lights if motion is detected. Pretty neat. I cannot comment on battery life yet, but it's been a few weeks and it still shows 100%. The sensor is activated multiple times a day. They include double sided tape to attach it to the door and the door jamb. Seems like its staying attached well.Read more"

A notification 30 minutes (not exaggerating here - literally 30) after the door is used is pointless to me.  It's actively unhelpful if, after I've come in for the night, gotten ready for bed, and am just starting to drift off, THE NOTIFICATION FINALLY COMES IN AND WAKES ME UP.Trash tier product.  I neglected sending it in during the refund window so I am just throwing the item in the trash.

If the range of delay was 1-3 seconds, I could mayyyyybe think that on my blazing fast wifi with 1Gbps internet, something on one of my devices was hogging the bandwidth for a moment.  But in actual fact (as a former network engineer) this is like the company making a frying pan out of particle board and then writing ""if your food is full of wood chips, you probably live in a construction zone.""

I haven’t figured out how to add it to my Apple Home app but for my needs it doesn’t really matter. It says you have to scan the barcode to do that but that isn’t working for me but honestly I haven’t given it much effort. I set it up without having to read the instructions cause it was so simple. The alarm only works if you have your phone ringer on, which mine is always off but the notification on silent is enough for my needs.

I'm AB'ing it with two Echo 4s (in stereo) and the Klipsch the One. For a small office. I'm testing the tracks I've used to assess my larger aspirational audiophile speakers, where I know all the dynamics and instrumental separation of the tracks fairly well. In short, the Sony way outperforms the others.Two echos do provide stereo of course which is great. And I actually can recommend those in stereo. Less so on a singular echo especially comparing to the Sony. Again, not even close. Also the echos don't integrate well with Tidal and have no chromecast which the Sony does; a major reason I bought the speaker. (The echoes are obviously smart speakers however, while the Sony is not).Might be some confusion about soundstage if you've read reviews. The Sony doesn't at all mimic a wide left to right soundstage. BUT it does present a deep soundstage that provides great musical separation. The overall tuning and dynamics is way better than the other speakers. You can tweak it further with the faux 360 setting and the five band eq in the app. Both work well and the 360 isn't *totally* a gimmick. The simulated 360 effect (more like a mix/mastering affect on the track including what sounds like subtle use of reverb) works well with some recordings and less so with others. Like the LR soundstage, this too doesn't ""surround"" you, it just adds depth and color to the presentation of the output.A Similar comparison to the Klipsch One which is a cool little speaker. The One can't create the same soundstage and musical separation. It's more one dimensional and boxed in ( I still love it). . The Sony captures the ""feel"" of listening to these tracks on my higher end setup. That's the benefit of this speaker. It captures the presentation and feel of hifi (to some degree) in a very small and attractive box. I also like the aux input. I have it set up in the corner of the small room which is decent for the speaker's sound dispersion and 90 degree tweeter orientation I'd say. Also it can get fairly loud.Read more"

I have it linked up to my Alexa and can stream directly with my voice, or I can switch it to Bluetooth mode with the press of a button to stream from my phone.

The sound didn’t sound quite right to my liking but after playing with the app that connects to this speaker it became a much better listening experience. Don’t use the EQ settings that the app has pre-saved! Choose the custom one and tweak it to your liking and it will be a better listening experience! I also have the Sony WH-1000XM3 with a custom EQ and I used the same EQ settings on this speaker which made it sound clearer with slightly more bass.The Sony 360 Reality/Immersive Audio Enhancement button experience was not all that. I tried Amazon Music Unlimited with Sony 360 Audio Reality and although you can hear the artists voice better, the songs sounds flat and much more quiet. I don’t think it’s worth it at this time but I do see it getting better in the future. Just stick with stereo once you tweak the custom EQ to your liking. The only time I use the Immersive Audio Enhancement button is at night when I’m watching Golden Girls for my nightly routine so it’s not too loud for my partner and it’s easier to hear their voices.This speaker is not bad at all.

Tidal has pulled it from their platform leaving Amazon Music HD & Deezer as the last two streaming services offering 360 Reality Audio (I believe). So, for the price, and without much opportunity to use the technology it was mainly built for, it is way too pricey. Without 360 it functions ok as a standalone speaker or integrated into an existing surround sound (although if using Bluetooth to connect, the timing might be off unless your other speakers allow audio sync). If you don't plan on utilizing the 360 Reality Audio, I would pass on this.Read more"

I was replacing an older pair of Logitech speakers that took up too much real estate on my desk so a sound bar was more of what I was looking for. I tried multiple variations from different brands, all sounding too flat/ muddy or too tinny with no mid range or lows.Finally, I received this one from Vizio and did a side-by-side comparison with some of the other top contenders I was considering. I listened to audio books for dialogue (since I’ll be using it for Zoom calls), I listened to various genres of music and I watched a few movie trailers as tests for each speaker. In the end, it was hands down the Vizio. Not only does the size and look fit perfectly on my desk between my laptop and my 24 inch monitor but the speaker had the best treble, mid range and lows out of the six different speakers I compared. This thing won’t blow you away with bass, but it’s enough that you can hear the lower frequencies in the music, unlike many of the others I listened to. It has a subwoofer output for a powered sub, if more bass is what you’re looking for. None of the other speakers I looked even had that option.This thing will primarily be used for conference calls with occasional music while I’m working, but it fits my needs and what I’m looking for. It has that sweet spot. Like I said, I compared it to several other brands and this was my pick. There’s plenty of YouTube videos on it as well. Granted you can’t hear the audio as well through your phone or tablet speakers, but you’ll have to take my word for it…it’s great!Read more"

Since that TV isn't our main television, I didn't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a soundbar for the TV that only is used a couple of hours a week.I bought a Vizio TV for that bedroom to replace an old Sony and was very impressed with the quality of the TV as well as a WELL thought-out design in the software, so I decided to give the same brand a chance with the soundbar.I wasn't disappointed!  Setup took less than 10 minutes and it was up and running.  After adjusting the bass and treble, I found the sound to be quite good from such a small soundbar without a subwoofer.  I connected it to the television using a digital/optical cable which, IMHO, is always preferable to an analog audio cable.This little soundbar is packed with options and tweaks.  I AM an audiophile and very demanding for my audio equipment.  However, I think that this soundbar is perfect for a guest bedroom OR for anyone on a budget.  The sound quality is great.  You can also connect auxiliary devices to it (i.e., game console, CD player, etc) AND it will connect to Bluetooth devices as well.If I had to criticize anything, I think that they could have done better with the ""quick setup"" guide instructions.  When I first powered up, the soundbar stated that it was searching for an input device and to turn on my TV.  It wasn't until I used the included remote to switch inputs to ""Digital/Optical"" that I was able to connect to the TV.  This is a very MINOR complaint.  Otherwise, I'm totally satisfied.

I was listening to music via Bluetooth, and heard a song from like 1998 that I've listened to dozens of times and I heard things I had never noticed before.I had a hard time setting this up and I'm pretty tech savvy. I'll include some tips that helped me. I have a Hisense Google TV and wanted to use the RCA connection (the soundbar includes an audio cable with RCA on one end and 3.5mm on the other). The TV has one set of RCA jacks but I did not know until today that they are A/V IN jacks (not out). I think that's dumb but I can't change it. Luckily, the soundbar also included an adapter just for this scenario. It turns RCA into 3.5mm, and the TV has a 3.5mm out jack. One other alternative would be to have just a 3.5mm cord. I'm editing this review to add that the 3.5mm cord plus adapter was causing the audio to drop. I decided to switch to optical and haven't had any problems with that.After that, it still wasn't working. I thought of trying to  turn up the volume and that did it. I had to fiddle with the TV and soundbar volumes until they were both kind of in the middle because at first one of them was up all the way and giving me a warning about loud volume.Just a note about Bluetooth: the soundbar connected fine via Bluetooth, but there was an audio delay when I used Chromecast to play video on the TV. I cast video from my phone almost all the time because for me it's easier to control. The cast video doesn't have an audio delay when it's connected via a cable. I actually tried a different soundbar a couple weeks ago with Bluetooth and it did the same thing. So I think that's something that needs to be fixed across the board.The soundbar is substantial and fairly heavy. I'm happy with it now that I was able to connect it. I also like that I can disable the auto-shut off.Read more"

The design is pleasing to the eye, and the entire unit looks well-constructed and elegant. The physical controls on the speaker are fairly intuitive and easy-to-use, along with an informative light to indicate the speaker status. The size is large enough for a strong sound projection, but easy to handle and compact, not bulky at all.The entire setup is very quick and easy. It’s basically as simple as plug and play. Google Home guides you smoothly through the process of connecting the device to the network. Connecting via Bluetooth, USB, and AUX works as well. RIVA has its own lightweight app to manage the playback, and the app’s controls are also very easy to operate. I was able to painlessly play music from a variety of libraries, including my local library and Spotify.The sound quality is excellent, and it carries well even far below full volume. Having tested the speakers outdoors and within various large rooms, it is safe to say that the RIVA’s sound is outstanding in a broad range of situations. Both bass and brass sound are well-defined on the RIVA, without any distortion. The speaker has produced exceptional sound with all the music that I have tested on it, on a level comparable to other much more expensive high-end speakers (Reference 3A, Made in France) that I own. I am very pleased with the RIVA and would highly recommend it to anyone--including audiophiles--looking for a high-quality wireless speaker.Read more"

No response from company, check the Facebook page in the community section to see all the complaints.Whilst the sound quality is good, the speaker would disappear on the Riva app stopping any remote control use. Whilst it could still be manually controlled it limited the ease of use. After a year, it no longer shows up on the app at all and cannot be connected to using Chromecast. Even after a factory reset it won't respond, which severely limits to functionality of this device, one of the main reasons it was purchased. I contacted their customer service on Jan 5, which states they will respond within 1 business day. Considering it is now 8th March I'm giving up on any response from them, even though I have tried numerous times since.The app is poor, the connectivity is unreliable, the customer support is non-existent but the sound quality is good.A shame as it had the promise of a Sonos rival.Read more"

I am impressed.,"I searched long and hard  looking for a powered tabletop speaker that could fill a kitchen with sound, and keep accurate sound detail even at higher volume levels and chose the Riva Festival.  The Riva's Festial's sound was better than I could have hoped for.  The frequency curve does sound accurate and flat without fake boomy bass.  The speaker box is heavy and inert, which helps with loud and accurate sound reproduction and the 3 side array of active drivers makes the playback more immersive.  Placement is important, and the unit will get a little more bass heavy if the passive radiators are right next to a wall, so I pulled my Riva a little bit away from the wall.  I am using Chomecast Audio on 3 other systems and integrated the Riva without a hitch.  I've only had the unit for several hours now but so far the stereo's and Riva have all stayed kept themselves in time and in sync during music playback.  I played cool jazz and the horns sounded breathy and had presence, and were enjoyable to listen to without any ice-pick highs to deal with.  I listened to classic hip-hop and rock and I was impressed at how low the bass response went on this speaker before it hit roll off.  I haven't had this speaker long enough to say anything about it's reliability, but the unit is solid, substantial and appears to be well built.Read more"

I made it my default speaker and tried to play music over it through voice commands via my google speaker devices and was never able to do so. When I cast to it from my phone it sounds really good, but the volume to cast is only adjustable in when you open the cast window. I wanted to be able to control this unit by voice command through my other devices, and that never really panned out for me. I was ok with that, and was just going to bite the bullet and keep the unit because the sound is really great. Then I had issues a few times with the unit not connecting to my wifi, then not connecting through bluetooth to my phone or my friend's phone. I had to restart the unit, restart my phone, factory reset the unit, remove the unit from my list of connected devices, restart again, wait... wait... wait... then finally get the unit to reconnect and communicate with other devices, for what? To listen to music that I could have, and should have been doing 15 minutes ago. It was the third time the unit dropped from the network and was unable to connect with my device where I decided enough was enough. I am now in the return process with the Riva because I'm out of amazon's return window. The first representative from their customer service sent the initial claim e-mail to the wrong e-mail address. The second was able to look up my name to find the previous communication between myself and the company. My name is Travis Thomas , the representative entered my email as travis.thompsonxx@xx.com, I understand everyone makes mistakes, but it's a simple one and it delayed my return significantly, because I only get in the mood to go through with tedious processes every so often.  So here I am, still in return process, I'll update with how things go. I may end up waiting and just go with the Stadium when it comes out, as the integrated alexa technology may fix my biggest issues with the unit.Read more"

This particular Vizio soundbar is twice defective. Do not buy this soundbar. I am most disappointed because I also own a great 65"" Vizio TV and an older model soundbar used in the bedroom. This one/model I purchased for my office and was planning to use it with a Panasonic plasma TV. Yes, the plasma is now considered old/outdated TV technology. However, it has a beautiful picture and works great.The following is my experience with this soundbar and Vizio support. The first SB I received would only work for about 5 seconds and then silence. And BTW - this SB is really easy to set up. Just plug in the power cord to the subwoofer, connect the power cord to the SB, and plug in the HDMI-ARC cable from the TV to the SB. Once you do that the SB recognizes the input and begins working. Easy! However, it would only stay on for about 5 seconds and then turn off. After my initial troubleshooting, I contacted Vizio support. We tried everything several times and nothing resolved my issue. (actually Visio's issue now) Vizio then shipped me a complete replacement. I did have to provide them (Vizio) a CC so they could place a hold for the price I paid Amazon in case I didn't return the SB.The second/replacement SB I received at first worked great. For a while. Again, the setup was easy and the SB worked and sounded great. The next morning I turned on the TV and SB and it worked for about 3 hours. Then it failed. Once again I tried troubleshooting it. No luck so I called support again. This time after about 1 hour - 15 minutes with Level 1 support and without resolving the issue I requested a call back from a higher level support. Crickets. No call back after waiting several hours.There is something very strange and wrong about this SB. Once it turned itself off I discovered that if I lightly touched the SB it would come back on - for about 5 seconds and then shut off. One time I got it working again and then slightly scooted it - and it shut off. Something is very wrong with this SB and I haven't a clue why it doesn't work properly. Vizio doesn't seem to know either. It's such a simple SB as it's only the bar/speaker and subwoofer. Very similar to the one in my bedroom which has been awesome! Bottom line - do not buy this model of Vizio soundbar.EDIT and REVIEW UPDATE 8-27-24After all of the above I resend my Do Not Buy suggestion and 1 star rating. Here's why....I received a phone call from a high level customer rep and support person and on the day I was going to return both SB's. Now it's working great. During my discussing with the support rep I mentioned that I could simply touch the SB and it'd start working for 5 seconds before turning off. She then suggested that I move the SB away from the TV as far as the cables allowed. (I had the sound bar positioned right next to and centered in front of the TV screen.) I then sat the SB on the floor about 4-5 feet away from the TV. And guess what? It started working perfectly and did so for a short test period. As you can see from the photo, I now have the SB sitting just below the TV on a shelf. It's been working perfectly and the sound quality IMO is really good from a fairly low cost SB and subwoofer setup. It seems that this 12 year old Panasonic plasma TV emits some sort of magnetic or other field/wave that interferes with the SB. Strange. Anyway, I'm very pleased with the SB and now recommend it with 5-stars.Read more"

This will push the sound toward you, which makes a world of difference. The soundbar is small and I have it mounted just below the tv on the wall, it almost looks like part of the tv. The remote is simple but once you set the bass/-treble it works flawlessly integrated with the TV and firestick remote to turn on with the TV and adjust volume.Can also link up to it through bluetooth for playing music through your phone. Don't really notice sound or bass from the seperate bass speaker. All I wanted was to hear my tv and this bar adds bass, treble and pumps the volume 1000% better than the measly tv speakers.

It arrived quickly and well packaged in a very highly promoted box. If you live in an area where theft could be a problem be sure to be there when it arrives or change the packaging type when asked if you prefer manufacturer boxing or not. Sometimes that is an option while checking out from Amazon online. The most awesome part was how simple and quickly installation was. I literally plugged in the bar and subwoofer and connected the HDMI cable to my tv and bar and suddenly I heard a voice. The sound bar talked me through set up! Crazy cool! As far as how it sounds. This is an area I feel like I'll never truly be pleased. As a musician that plays many instruments but prefers bass guitar, I'll never feel like there's enough bass. For ""normal"" ears it's probably fine. You can definitely hear low ends and it's not muddy. Or a constant low end hum. But it also doesn't rattle the floor, pictures on the wall, or cups in the cabinet. Nor can you feel it in your chest. It is loud enough and you can clearly hear dialogue. It's also nice that you can adjust the subwoofer separately from the sound bar. There are preset equalization settings and also separate treble/bass adjustments. The LED lights in the sound bar light up to show you levels on adjustments. The bar comes with wall mounting brackets and hardware. It's a good value and fair price. I'm happy with it. It would get a solid 5 star if the bass hit harder. It's close.I would happily recommend this product.Read more"

It has a voice feature where it tells you what EQ mode your in so you don't  have to guess. There's a handful of other nest features built in, one to make it more surround sound sounding which surprisingly works well. The sound quality is amazing.

Sound profile is excellent, great for music, dialogue is sharp from the movies. Bass isnt too overpowering but there when neededDefinitely no shortage of power here. I had to keep it mostly on volume 1 and up to 5, but no more than that! (out of 30)2. Atmos height effects is pronounced and easily detectable when playing the right movies3. HDMI CEC and eARC works well, using just one remote with the LG OLED, simplifying connections too4. design fits well with decor, and the silver design isnt too drab, i think it fits well with most decor, not just mine5. setting up the sub (connecting it to the soundbar wirelessly) and the soundbar is pretty straightforwardthere are actually tons of diagrams on the box, in the box, on the soundbar... to guide you through initial setup6. the app offers quite a bit of control and it offered firmware update immediately7. there is quite a bit of tuning available but through another app (the Philips Sound app will guide you to download the 2nd app called PS Fine Tune)8. app is very usable, lots of adjustments and syncing with music streaming apps through google chromecast connectivityMinuses:1. subwoofer is shaped a bit bulky but im sure they have their reason for that in order to produce that level of bass2. while the remote control is nicely designed, it uses IR instead of RF or Bluetooth... oh well but it does allow to be used more universally with other remote controls such as chromecast's remote controlnot a big issue i suppose, especially with HDMI CEC, you'd be more likely to be using the TV's remote to control its volume anyways3. cant wait to test the play-fi surrounds but still have to wait for it to go on sale (i wonder if it works well with Klipsch play-fi speakers?)Read more"

These small speakers sound great and are soooo easy to set up.  I now have a few in various rooms and have whole-house wireless music without drilling and running wires through attics and under the home.  Did I mention they are soooo easy to set up?No, these are not massive, large speakers that will fill a huge room with driving bass by using just one speaker.  They are what they are -- excellent smaller speakers well under $500 that sound great and are perfect for a typical-sized room in a house.  They are good looking, discrete, and are easily tucked away within room decor.  I put two on opposite corners of rooms and the rooms sound wonderful.  I added a subwoofer in the larger living room next to my entertainment center.  It's like I now live inside a big speaker shaped like a house, and the music comes from everywhere when I walk from room to room.  It is exactly what I wanted and am very pleased. I have always found Yamaha audio equipment to be top notch.I also found the Music Cast app so easy to install on my phone and use.  Don't know why some other people have said it is difficult to use.  They must work for the competition and are planting negative reviews.  I can easily use the app to control the volume speaker-by-speaker, use EQ settings speaker-by-speaker, set up presets with all speakers and levels already set up and accessible by choosing the correct preset number, or I can use presets to have certain speakers off when I want to listen in only one room downstairs and not bother other people upstairs, I can turn on and off the AV receiver and all speakers with the press of one button, can access Pandora and Spotify (those are the ones I use) without turning on my Smart TV or Blu-ray, can skip songs, make playlists, give thumbs up and down to songs, etc., etc, all from the app on my phone.I also have had no problems at all with music cutting in and out like some people have commented.  That must be due to them having a poor wifi signal problem.  I have a Netgear Orbi wifi system with satellites in two places throughout my two-story home.  My wifi signal is fine and the speakers have not cut in and out or lost signal at all.  Ever.  Not even once.  Remember,  if you start adding six or more speakers, plus a wireless AV receiver, and have your cell phone set on wifi to control the app and the speakers, you have just added eight or more devices onto your wifi system, in addition to all the other devices that were already using your wifi.  So, make sure you have a good wifi signal and all will be fine.So far, I am VERY happy with these Yamaha speakers and their Music Cast system.Read more"
Voice Assistants,"YAMAHA WX-021 MusicCast 20 Wireless Speaker, Alexa Voice Control, White",279.,4.1,352,https://us.amazon.com/dp/B07CLKMRM1,5.0,"July 3, 2020",5.0 out of 5 starsImprovements,"I heavily invested in Yamaha MusicCast not long after it was launched.  I purchased the RX-V681 receiver, six wired speakers, two WX-010's and two WX-030's.  I mostly listen to SiriusXM and music I've purchased.  I emailed Yamaha a couple of times asking them to include Amazon Music as a source, because I have Prime.  They always said ""we're working on it.""  Well, last fall they made it available, but only for their latest equipment.  So I spent over a thousand dollars on Yamaha products, and none of them got the firmware update that added Amazon Music.  I seriously considered ditching everything and switching to a competitor's system after that.  Instead, I finally decided to buy an Echo smart speaker.  I have the two previous generation Echo Dots, but based on my experience with them I've never been a fan of Alexa.  (My favorite thing about her is reading the 1 star reviews written by frustrated users, which is always good for a laugh.)  Even though the speaker sounded good, I ended up returning it.  Using a Kindle Fire with the smart speaker didn't work well, but the bigger problem is Amazon's music service, which constantly disconnects and has major issues with volume level.  But as a classical music lover, it seemed like I was cheating myself by paying for Prime and not using the music service.  Even though the selections on their stations aren't that great, a lot of albums stream with Prime, e.g. many of the Naxos recordings.  So, even though it's substantially more expensive, I decided to purchase the WX-021.  The unit is larger than I thought it would be, measuring about 6 by 7.5 inches.  Sound quality is good, and there is a basic equalizer built into the app.  Although I've had some issues in the past with music being interrupted, either Yamaha or Sirius (or both) seem to have worked out the problem.  The speaker holds the most recently played Sirius channel in memory, so if you listen to the same channel a lot you can just use the power button to turn it on and off.  This unit also allows you to save three favorites and access them by touching buttons on top of the speaker.  The MusicCast app actually works really well when you need it, and the WX-021 includes Amazon Music as a source, even allowing you to search for recordings included with Prime.  Unfortunately, none of my other MusicCast equipment has this capability, but it's possible to link the WX-021 to other units through the app.  Another caveat is that even when using Amazon Music within the MusicCast app, the service still stops unexpectedly.  I know this is an Amazon issue, because I sometimes listen to Sirius all day without stopping.  The only other downside to MusicCast is that Sirus on demand is not included.  The speaker has to be wirelessly connected to a phone or tablet running the Sirius app for that to work.Read more"

Voice Assistants,"Bose Home Speaker 500: Smart Bluetooth Speaker with Alexa Voice Control Built-in, Silver",229.,4.3,"5,280",https://us.amazon.com/dp/B07FD5FZ9P,5.0,"August 30, 2019",5.0 out of 5 starsVery Happy with this Purchase - Excellent Streaming Speaker,"For the past few years, I've been listening to music on Amazon Echo speakers, which I had synced in various rooms throughout my house. Because I had been listening to music more and more, when my family and I decided to move, I wanted to upgrade my speakers.I originally was set on getting a pair of the KEF LSX. Though I've never heard them, after all my research, I am sure they are amazing speakers. I also wanted to get some other less expensive speakers (at least compared to the LSX) for other parts of the house that I could sync to (using Air Play 2). I tested out a lot of options in this price range (and even a bit more expensive, like the Sonos Play 5).When we were in the process of moving, I decided on and ordered a Home Speaker 500. After using it for a day, I was so impressed by this speaker that I decided to forego the KEF LSX and just use the Bose throughout the house, so I ordered two more. So, for about the price of on set of LSX, I now have awesome speakers throughout my house. I'm sure I sacrificed sound quality by not getting the LSX (and I definitely sacrificed getting stereo sound on a wide soundstage), but, honestly, I love the sound of the Home Speaker 500, so I don't think I need anything that is 'audiophile' grade.What I Love Most:-The sound is full and rich. I don't know how to describe it otherwise, but everything I listen to sounds fantastic.-The speakers can also get really loud without any discernible distortion. I haven't pushed them to their full volume as they are quite loud enough even at 50% or 60%, and the sound really does fill the room (and the next room!).-The look & overall build quality. They are really handsome speakers with a substantial size without being too bulky. I also appreciate the aluminum finish much more than I expected I would. The aluminum also gives the speaker a really nice heft to it. Nothing about this speaker feels or looks cheap to me (which is partly why it's not a cheap speaker, obviously).-The screen. I have read reviews that criticize the screen as not useful and not in line with the current aesthetic for speakers. But, honestly, I listen to a lot of playlists on Spotify, and it's nice to be able to see what's playing. And, even when I'm playing stuff I know, I like seeing the album art.-EQ adjustments in the Bose app. You can change treble and bass on a pretty wide range (-100 to 100, with 0 being default). When we first moved in, we didn't have any rugs down, so the sound was way too bright. A small adjustment in the EQ made a huge difference. Now that we have some rugs down, I've adjusted the EQ again back towards the default, and they continue to sound great. Even though these speakers don't self-tune like some of the other speakers in this class (Sonos, Apple, and Google all do to some extent), the tuning you can do as a user I think will make these speakers work for you in any space. And, the speaker does have a host of microphones, so self-tuning is always something Bose could add in the future.(Minor) Complaints-The way groups work is a little different than with Amazon's Echo ecosystem. Instead of creating groups ahead of time, you have to go into the Bose app to create groups ad hoc. So, you can't ask Alexa to play music on a particular group of these Bose speakers. Instead, you have to get music started on one speaker and then create the group you want in the Bose app. Once it's set up and is playing continuously, any music command given to Alexa continues to play on that group. If you stop playing music, the group eventually dissolves. The positive to this is that you can also edit groups (add and remove speakers) on the fly without really interrupting the music. With the Echo ecosystem, I don't think this was possible (except possibly if you were using Spotify Connect with your Echo groups).-The app and software can be a bit buggy. It always does what I want it to -- eventually. And it doesn't take long to do what I want it to do. But it also doesn't always work the first time (such as creating or editing a group). Also, album art sometimes disappears, replaced by a generic, white musical note. I will say that the more I have used my speakers, the less buggy the system tends to be. Maybe I'm just becoming more proficient at navigating the software's quirks, or maybe Bose is making some updates to the speakers that I am not aware of.-Bose used two side-firing drivers in this speaker, which is supposed to give a wider soundstage for stereo sound. I don't really hear much stereo in these speakers, even with songs that have a lot of it (such as ""Such Great Heights"" by The Postal Service). That said, the side-firing speakers do create a more room-filling sound as Bose claims. And, really, similar to the Echo, the sound quality doesn't change a lot no matter where you are in relationship to the speaker (though the little stereo you might get straight on gets lost completely if you are not more or less straight on to the front or back of the speaker).All in all, I absolutely recommend this speaker. It's a bit on the pricier side compared to some of the other speakers it gets compared to (but not all), but, for what I was looking for, I'm really quite satisfied.Read more"

I wanted a Bluetooth speaker that could fill the room with good sound. My only complaint about this speaker is the price.As others have said the sound is full, has depth & while not stereo, if in front of it almost seems like it.Contrary to the instructions I did not start with their app. I already have it for my Soundbar 700, and just wanted to use as an ordinary Bluetooth speaker. No problem there, press the Bluetooth button on it and saw it on my Samsung Galaxy Bluetooth list. Hit Pair and it connected immediately. When I played my Apple music it identified the song and artist.This plugs in, no battery to charge, yay! Also just a plug, no bulky transformer to try and find a place to plug in. And no on/off switch surprised me. Guess since ac powered don't need one.Then I opened the Bose app and of course it wanted to add it in with my soundbar. Didn't work until the 3rd try. Then about a15 minute download to the latest ware. Then you had to click on the app in your Bluetooth list to make it work. It has a few features like adjust the tone etc. Not of interest to me as fine as it is for my environment. In order to just do it as a regular Bluetooth speaker had to close the app and re-pair it to my phone directly. I will listen to my Apple music and some streaming online music sources all directly without needing the Bose app.Once you get over the sticker shock likely you will love it. I have a few other somewhat expensive Bluetooth speakers and this one blows them all away. Have had some issues with my Bosesoundbar, hopefully this won't have any.Read more"

No to Apple HomePod 2 or Sonia Move,"I belabored over this purchase so I want to share what I learned. First of all, I started out looking for a Home solution that used a Voice Assistant (like Alexa or Siri) and something that would primarily be stationary and utilize my home’s Wi-Fi to play music, control lights, and replace the speakers I had my turntable connected to (for an optimized smaller overall footprint).First I was SO PUMPED for the timing of Apple’s HomePod 2 with better price and fancier flashing lights. Then I realized all of its limitations. Limitations that are actual standard on the Bose Smart Speaker 500.Not available on Apple HomePod 2, but available on the Bose 500:- Bluetooth capable- Aux input (for my turntable)- Ability to adjust treble and bass- Alexa assistant- SiriusXM streaming- Radio station programmable presets- streaming services like Spotify, Deezer, Pandora, Amazon MusicBecause more than a couple of these greatly improve the application, I went with the Bose 500 and I am so happy I did. The sound is so Bose; beautifully balanced and well executed. Sure it doesn’t have an indoor temperature readout, room mapping abilities or the mesmerizing color changing screen like Apple’s HomePod 2, but it has a pretty badass little display that shows artist/album details, or the station if you’re playing radio over internet.I can play my favorite stations from the cities I visit the most, right here at home. Incredible!And best of all is the QUALITY Bose sound and incredible sound output at high volumes.To me there is a clear choice! It’s all about the Bose Smart Speaker 500. BTW I also own the Sonos Move which competes with these speakers, the Bose sound quality is so much crisper and cleaner in my opinion.Read more"

Had a recent thought to see what's new in SB tech to match up with my now 2021 model TV.Late 2017 I moved from a home theatre 7.2.2 Denon AVR, Polk all the way around to RV living and that's why the SB systems now, room.  Was pleased to see Atmos speakers making it to these devices so readily with more options increasing speakers above 5.1 as if I recall, that was the extent of them back in 2017.Looked at Vizio first since previous purchase was a win, was contemplating a 5.1.2 one only to see the price drop another $100, that would of hurt had I been rash, I had a budget in mind, but I'm also exploring new tech, so budget can flex on features.  Checking out what Samsung had to match their TV product, found the 910B 9.1.2 system at 50% off (2022 model), but there is a 910C (2023 model) significantly higher (not on sale), so I spent time going through all the Samsung models to come back to the initial conclusion, the price drop on the 910B is way to good to pass up as I don't even see what features the 910C adds as the newer replacement model except a reduced ""list price"".  The 990C while a couple more clear advantages, was way more than I wanted to spend, but if the 990C were 50% off, oh ya, nice step up from 910B, I would have raised my budget.So I pulled the trigger with SKG USA as their seller rating is stellar with enough count, Amazon shipped, I felt good about this purchase.  Item arrived, all new, looks great.  I got the impression from reviews that this is one of those devices us guys shouldn't just disregard the setup instructions on, so I followed them by step and everything went smoothly.The sound blows me away, it's the same upgrade as when I went from dinky tv speakers in the RV to the Vizio 5.1, the bass on this 9.1.2 sitting right behind and firing into my loveseat just rocks the RV.  The SB is just explosive, threw movies like Expendables 3 in for the booms and such.  In all fairness to the Atmos which may work as advertised, I unfortunately am not the best reviewer for that as the bar doesn't sit in a room for me like most people in a house, about knee height 5.5' from head, so actually getting sound bounced off ceiling vs hearing direct is questionable, but the Atmos speakers absolutely help fill the room with sound.I do use the E/ARC having 3 sources in TV and I run our free cable box through the extra HDMI on the SB.  I also use the Smart Things app for both devices, that works well too as it provides easy source switching between ARC, SB HDMI and phone bluetooth when playing music which is very full with powerful bass.Love the 411 read out display in front and also an assumed feature, when raising/lowering the volume, there is a minor delay to a click for the volume to change.  Not sure how necessary this feature is, but I like it and it has a premium feel to its operation.  When I know and exact number I want a volume at, the number can move quick, but it provides a gradual audio glide to it to the final level, whichever direction.All in all I'm very pleased with the fantastic price on a quality SB system to match with Samsung TV and I went through all the manufacture toys and everything just works.  The black metal finish is very cool and good use of angles.Only annoyance so far, I like keeping it on ""Adaptive Sound"", a gaming system will auto change it to ""Game Sound"" which is great, but does not auto set back, nor does the reclamation of any other input on E/ARC return it to Adaptive.  Haven't seen the settings solution myself yet, not too worried at this point, but if this is my only known complaint after enough setup and time used, an electronic win.If this is still less than six hundred and fifty from SKG USA, don't worry about it, I checked it out and it's a great deal for a great product!  Nothing else can touch a 9.1.2 with a side fire bass system at that price!Read more"

To be honest, I was perfectly happy with the Q80R, in fact, it's an absolute beast for a stand alone soundbar - but the lack of any real meaningful volume from the SWA-9000S surrounds was like fumbling on the 5 yard line.  Enter the Q910B, which checks every box I was looking for and thensome.The room: The Q910B is approximately 8.5 feet from my ears, while the subwoofer is beside the TV stand, approximately 20"" from the wall, and the surround speakers are mounted on the wall about one foot behind and one foot above the listening position, approximately 8 feet apart, angled slightly downward. The ceiling, for bouncing the upward firing speakers, is approximately 6.5 feet above the top of the soundbar.Putting the Q910B through it's paces for movies, I found that Adaptive Sound works the best, with Space Fit on, Active Voice Amplifier off, Bass Enhancement on and Voice Enhancement off.  Dolby Atmos content is quite immersive - Top Gun Maverick, Avengers Endgame and Devotion all created a wonderful envelope of sound.  Switching to DTS X films - Jurassic World Dominion, Backdraft and Independence Day were all very impressive, moreso than even Atmos content.  Running through a myriad of Dolby and DTS Blu-ray discs was no less impressive, albeit with no overhead sound.  In all cases, the surround channels were strong and lower bass was abundant.  The soundstage was wide across the board, with excellent pinpointing of where the sound should be coming from given the context of the scene no matter the type of surround mastering that was being used.Moving onto music content, the Q910B more than competent.  The soundstage in Adaptive Sound mode was very good, while bass was solid and well controlled.  Even when streaming Amazon Music using the built-in Alexa, there was better definition and more treble than was available with the Q80R.  Using Bluetooth from my phone was a breeze and provided even higher fidelity.Overall, I'd give the Q910B a 9 out 10, with the caveat that it fits my environment perfectly.  Given the lack of space behind my listening position, the surround speakers found with both the Q930B and Q990B would have been overkill.  That said, I think those bars would work better in larger rooms and where the surround speakers can be placed farther from the listening position.Read more"

The software, hardware, and platform teams are just doing their own things and made this frankenstein monster that doesn't do anything particularly good.The RA5000 has 1 primary focus: 360 reality audio. Which isn't that great to begin with. The rest of features are all horribly implemented. It's just not worth it.I'll say what I like first:1) Looks kinda sleek, with black mesh and warm, copper grills. HOWEVER it looks like a Phillips razor from top. And it's kind of a running joke of the audio community.2) For genres that works with 360 reality, it's not too bad. You can have this 1 speaker sitting in the middle of a room, or a corner, and play light, background music, and it'll fill the space and sound like it's coming from all around. HOWEVER this is the only thing the speaker is good for.Now what I hate (strong word but accurately describes how piss poor this thing performs):1) Horrible connectivity. On paper it has everything: bluetooth, wifi, 3.5mm. But it's poorly implemented. Everything's tied to the app which is designed to make you set up Tidal and Alexa. And it all has to sync through Chromecast.1.a) You cannot proceed to use app without setting up chromecast. The message will pop up EVERY SINGLE TIME, even if you click ""do not show again"". Unless you download Google home, Chromecast, and pair it. So if you distrust google and don't want anything Google on your phone, too bad. You have to install the biggest trojan horse and most evil thing mankind has created in 5000 years of civilization history, on your personal phone. Make no sense1.b) Even after you pair, it works very poorly. It works as well as 1% the experience of Airplay2, which the speaker does not support.1.c) It's constantly confused about which connection you have, bluetooth or wifi or w/e. And you have to constantly use the physical touch-sensitive buttons on the side to toggle. There is no remote and the app, like I said, is a horrible advertisement for Google services that they shove down your throat.1.d) since these are passive when connected through 3.5mm, you need something with powerful amp to push it. When you do though, and you have the 360 Audio turned OFF, then the speaker sounds like it has potential, if it could be paired in stereo pairing - which it cannot, because they wanted this to be only for 360 Reality Audio.2) Sound - like I said before, it's only good for the kind of music, and the kind of usage that puts the music in the ambiance, in the background. So like, doing house chores, this speaker is great, because no matter where I move around to, it'll sound like it's coming from all around me. But only for certain music that doesnt' emphasize vocals, rhythm, or bass.You can turn off the virtual surround. You'll get a taste of the true fidelity packed inside these speakers. Sony put quality speakers in here. You can tell by its bass and treble response when properly amped and have the virtual surround turned off. However since it's in 1 unit and you cannot stereo-pair, it s moot, and you are better off just turning on virtual surround and play Enya or Yani on it, in the background.3) For the terrible connectivity implementation, horrible App interface, and terrible mix of service, platform, UI, and design choices - by foregoing industry best practices and go 100% all in on Reality Audio, what you get is an awful product in a Shaver-look-alike package.This thing is a waste of space and I would not keep it even for $200.Read more"

That original switch was NOT a TP-Link product, and it did not connect with the KASA app, which is what most of our smart home devices used. We really prefer TP-Link and KASA connectivity because they are very user friendly.  If the power or the Internet go out, these devices usually reconnect automatically.  If they don't, resetting is very straight forward and quick.  This particular TP-Link switch was easy to install, and once installed, was super easy to connect to our Wi-Fi.  We love that we can adjust the lighting level from the switch or from the app.  This switch controls 24 outdoor eve lights without any connection issues.  Amazing!  The switch also matches the look of other wall switches in our house.  It's easy to use and very responsive.  We are very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it to anyone who wants to install a single pole smart switch.Read more"

They just work!,"Making your house smart shouldn’t be hard, and it shouldn’t involve creating accounts for the different devices you want to use. And it definitely shouldn’t involve giving up your privacy just so you can talk to your dining room lights.Until recently that’s what you had to do regardless of which smart system (Alexa, Google Home, Apple HomeKit, or Samsung Smartthings) you used. No system included everything you might want to use, your doorbell camera might be from Ring and your smart lock might be from Schlage. You’d have to create accounts in each then integrate them into your smart system.The new Smart home standard, called MATTER, attempts to change all of that by establishing compatibility standards for smart systems and devices without the need to create accounts or give up any privacy. If the device is MATTER compatible and your smart system works with MATTER, you just scan a QR code and the device is integrated. Simple, easy, done.If you’re a HomeKit user, this was a godsend. More smart device makers are adhering to the MATTER standards and these Kasa single pole smart dimmers shows just it should be done!Installation is marginally more complicated than installing a regular single pole switch. Once installed and powered, the dimmer works like any normal manual dimmer. The magic happens when you add the device to HomeKit.In HomeKit->add device, you scan the QR code. After about a minute HomeKit asks you a few more questions about how you want to integrate the switch. Answer those and you’re done! No new accounts or passwords you have to remember. The dimmers just work!Of course, Kasa would love for you to open an account so they can bombard you with info about other products they offer, but you don’t have to do it. The only reason you may decide to get an account is for firmware updates, but those are relatively rare.They look great too. I highly recommend these dimmers.Read more"

I use them with Feit recessed LEDs and the TP-Link Deco M9 router.Pros:- They are a notable brand for what that is worth- They are very affordable relative to other name brand switches or going Z-Wave or Zigbee- Easy to install- They work relatively well with Feit bulbs which I have found to be very finicky.  They still don’t work perfectly and the bulbs still do still flicker a little at specific dimmer levels; but still better than other dimmer switches I have tried.- After rebooting my router, I have no issues with reconnections- Great integration with Home Assistant and Samsung SmartThings and can be cycled without an internet connectionCons:- No three-way option yet and you can only group up to 3 sets of switches in the Kaza app to mimic this function.  The workaround for this is to use Samsung SmartThings app which has equal if not better response time than Kasa’s native app.  I use the HS200 and HS220 with SmartThings to mimic a three way dimmer configuration.  In reality the HS220 controls the lights and the HS200 is powered but not connected to any lights directly.  The downside to this configuration is only the dimmer switch works manually without internet.  Response time between the switches is about 1 to 2 seconds using SmartThings or the Kasa app- I have had to reset one of my 23 devices in the past 6 months; however, that was as simple as pressing the reset button which just power cycles it, all setting are still saved- The dimmers have had a weird behavior that has happened twice where you turn them off, the switch will register as off including the indicator light on the switch itself, but the lights will still be on.  You have to press the switch again to “turn the light on” and then off again.  Again this has happened two times over several hundred cycles.Read more"

The Wi-Fi connectivity is reliable, and the remote control functions seamlessly, making it easy to navigate through various options. Installation was straightforward with the provided mounting kit, ensuring a secure fit that can be easily removed for cleaning purposes.To enhance my viewing experience, I connected a flat antenna box to the USB port, which significantly improved the reception of over-the-air channels. Additionally, the television allows access to all LG internet channels via Wi-Fi, along with a variety of other streaming services such as Plex, Freevee, Crackle, Pluto, and Tubi. This versatility makes it a fantastic entertainment hub for my bathroom.The only drawback I encountered was I had to purchase of a flat plug, which I believe should have been included with the television. A flat plug is a more suitable option, allowing for a cleaner installation and the ability to rotate and hide the cord from being visible. The provided plug is of an older design and protrudes from the wall, making it challenging to hide when the television is mounted higher up.Read more"

I will give it 5 stars and keep it at 5 stars.  Thoughtful suggestions - would be nice to be able to name the master when it comes up on bluetooth so you know which one to select when you need to.  Another why not put the bulb extensions in all lights or identify which ones include them or not.  The instructions need to be seriously reviewed like pairing the satellites via the QR code before installing them in the ceiling.

A bit pricey and bulky but they pack a nice punch.I installed these in my two lamps on either side of my bed. I used the iPad Bluetooth and quickly connected without any trouble. It also directed me to the app need to operate the lights. My biggest complaint is the are BIG. About twice the size of a standard bulb. I had to manipulate the brackets on both lamps and squeeze them in at an angle. They are still not seeded correctly but I made them work. ( both lamps are medium size)The light is a clean soft white 2600 lum ... Reminds me of natural daylight. The LEDs produce a very low high frequency hum. Slightly noticeable in a very quiet setting but not overwhelming. It's hard to avoid that sound with LEDs. The dimmer on the app works perfectly. Love it in my bed side setting!Having both bulbs on either side of the bed produce a surprising crisp solid sound. These little things actually Rock! The app comes with 8 presettings rock, jazz, ect. I have to say that the sound quality is very very good. I was able to play pandora as well as play music right off the iPad. Any sound produced by the pad comes out of the bulbs including games as well.These bulbs are very cool and can be used in any dry location. Besides the bulky install i have really enjoyed these neat little gadgets.Read more"

I want more people to buy them so they'll keep making them and the price will come down and every light in my house will be one of these.  This is a genius idea, with a very good implementation on the speaker side.  In fact, on the speaker side, I give these a 5 for sound.  Add Sonos integration and then you have 5 across the board on speakers.  As pure lights, they're also a 5 -- no start up delay, nice color temperature.  But at this price point, I want more than just light, I'd like Hue-type color change, synced to the music.  Then, I'd give this a full on 5.As I said above, the sound is pretty darn good.  Not going to be very bassy, but it has good volume, good sound even at low volume, and all in all good sound.  People are blown away when they realize the music is not coming from some hidden speaker in the ceiling, but from the light bulb.Also, incredibly easy to set up and use.

The speakers sound pretty good especially the mids and highs. Able to pair speakers (subwoofer or same bulbs) and add more. Able to control sound for each speaker. Able to use bluetooth from tv, phone, tablet or any device that sends bluetooth signals. Wireless!!!! Space saving by elimating soundbars and wired satellite speakers that sit on end tables or attached to walls.  What I dont like about these are: Can add only 8 total speakers. Which means I cant fill up all 12 cans and rock the house lol.  Only one color option for led which is white. I would like to be able to use multi colored leds and maybe different party modes to rotate through colors and flashing lights. Overall these are great sounding speaker lights.

The manufacturer is crystal clear that ""Alexa sound compatible"" means that you can use the system as a Bluetooth speaker for an Alexa device, NOT control the lights through the Alexa app.  Also, as this is a Bluetooth (not a wifi) device, it can only be connected to either your Alexa device OR your Apple device.  This makes using the system with Alexa impractical on a day-to-day basis in that you have to manually reconfigure your Alexa and Pulse app each time you want to switch between controlling the lights and controlling the speakers.  On the other hand, these are decent speakers and the system works just fine when controlled through only an Apple device.  Used without Alexa, I think it makes sense for a dorm room or small apartment where space and budget are tight.Read more"

If you are having a problem with Echo playing the right song, try this: ""Echo, play Blinding Lights by the Weeknd on Apple Music"" instead just saying ""Echo, play Blinding Lights."" Same ""Echo, play Christmas Jazz on Apple Music"" instead of ""Echo, play Christmas Music.""  The more specific you are, the better results.Calendar: I tried the Skylight and it is useless. The Echo Show will connect to your Apple Calendars. Our family does shared calendars, and everything shares over to our Echo Show, including announcing events and times to leave.Drop in: It's amazing! The camera will zoom and adjust automatically. Our Echo Show 10 does this, but it's on a swivel and always runs into things. This one is much smarter!  You can drop in from another Alexa device, or simple the Alexa app on a smart phone.Photos: We have all of our Echo Shows displaying photos that I have uploaded to Amazon photos and then select which photos to show using the Alexa app. Screen is so clear and large, better than any smart frame I've ever seen. And friends/family can share photos to it.Announcements: Announcements will show on the screen and announce (I also have push notifications to my watch/phone). Echo hears them perfectly and announces them correctly (our Echo 8 has stopped properly listening and announcing). You can also announce from the Alexa app if you are not home, very convenient for parents :)Widgets: Widgets are easy to add and adjust, just be patient and go through the process.Ads: To remove (most) ads, go into settings on the screen and turn everything to off! I barely get any. If you are still getting those annoying ""Wicked"" ads, it's because you have on the ""Theme"" setting. Once I turned that off, no more ""Wicked"" (or other future sponsored theme movies), even though we do like the theme setting (Mario is my favorite!).Pricing: Look for a sale. I got the 21"" for $350 on the Black Friday Sale.  Would have cost me more than that for a TV, sound bar, and Apple TV for our kitchen (which was our old setup).I LOVE all of our Echo devices. Our Gen 1 is still working amazingly, and glad to add the Echo 21"" to our home.Read more"

They were very easy to put together and can also hold a plastic bag to collect the trash instead of putting trash directly into the can. They are made of pretty good plastic and I think that they will hold together well. They do require AAA batteries which are not included. I have a dog who loves to get into trash, but these are dog proof, even for an 85 pound puppy. These are about the size of a bathroom trashcan and has plenty of capacity for a bathroom.  They are very lightweight, but sturdy enough to stay in place.The lid functions well...perhaps too well. The sensor is very sensitive and can open at times when you are not expecting it. But it doesn't stay open too long, thus my cats can't get too curious before it closes them out of the can. The operation is very quiet and hardly even noticable.Because of this can, I have been able to have a trashcan in both bathrooms again as it keeps all the critters in the house from getting into the trash and dragging it across the house.I really like these and they work great!

I'm taken with the smart color-coding system between the board and its corresponding knife. Speaking of knives, they're impressively sharp—I learned that the hard way! But when you're tackling steak and chicken, having sharp knives is a plus.I did anticipate needing to plug in the device, but I underestimated its height. My kitchen cabinets are lower than I thought, so every time I reach for a knife and board, I have to maneuver the device at a 45-degree angle to retrieve them. It's a minor inconvenience, though, and nothing I can't work around.Beyond just the handy icons reminding me which board and knife to use, there's another feature that really sold me on this device: the UV blue light. Being a tad paranoid about bacteria, having the ability to zap any lingering germs gives me peace of mind. Plus, having all my cutting boards conveniently stored in one spot prompted me to bid farewell to my other cutting board, freeing up valuable space in my kitchen.My only complaint is that, with such sharp knives, the veggie board is starting to show some wear and tear. It's no different than any other cutting board I've had, but I suspect years of use may require a replacement. All in all, however, it's been a worthwhile addition to my culinary arsenal.Read more"

However, I can take a pic of the nutrition label which registers all details accurately, but then I have to take a pic of the front of the product, fat-finger in the name of the product and brand.

The small size and flat profile don’t take up much space in my kitchen, and the stainless steel top plate matches my décor and is super easy to clean.I use it for multiple dogs as well as for myself, so I prefer that it doesn’t include a bowl. I have recorded weights for each empty dog bowl, the target food weight for each meal, and the total filled weight. When I place a bowl on the scale, I quickly check that it registers the correct empty weight before adding food until I reach the total meal weight — very efficient.Because I feed raw, a scale that’s smooth and easy to sanitize with antibacterial wipes is a must. This one fits the bill — no deep seams or tricky spots. The auto-off feature is handy, too.Occasionally I’ll hit a button that sets it to a negative weight (user error!), which is why I always recheck the empty bowl weight — probably a good habit anyway.Overall, this is a high-quality, reliable scale that’s easy to use and clean.

I am an experienced cook that is well versed in the use of a knife and a mandoline. If you have a tool like this that can make processing food easier, faster, and safer, I see no reason not to use it no matter how good your knife skills are. I also disagree there is a lot of prep work before this mandoline can be used. For some slicing some foods, like celery, carrots, etc. I generally cut pieces to be close to equal length. If the lengths are longer than the shoot, you can use your hand to push them until they get short enough to use the pusher.I use this mandoline primarily for cutting ingredients I use in our salads. Other than the greens, avocado, and cherry tomatoes I use, this mandoline is used for radishes, cucumber, red onion, red and green bell peppers, and carrots. If you are into salads, try cutting radishes with either a knife or a convention mandoline. Yes it can be done with a knife, and not with a conventional mandoline very easily. Cutting them with a knife takes time to cut them evenly and individually and you have to be careful they don't slip so you cut your fingers. With this mandoline, I cut off the ends of the radishes, put 4-5 of them in the chute of this mandoline, and they are all evenly sliced in less than 5 seconds. I haven't found a cucumber yet that would fit into the chute of this mandoline. I cut off the end on an angle, and again, enough evenly cut slices for two salads within less than 5 seconds. For peppers, cut them in half, remove the seeds and membranes, and put them in the chute of this mandoline fitting them together in layers. Again, perfect slices in less than 5 seconds.For red onions, I peel them, cut them into quarters, and put a couple of quarters in the chute. Again, enough for two salads cut into perfect even slices. For carrots using two carrots, I cut off the ends, cut the carrots in half, put the 4 pieces in the mandoline chute, and, again, less than 5 seconds to even slice all of the carrots.Honestly, I can't imagine trying to do all of this with a conventional mandoline as most will not cut anything that is not soft. I did used a knife prior to getting this mandoline, but it took me at least 15-20 minutes more to get all of these veggies cut and cut evenly. I am not a ""developmentally delayed person in cooking"", but I do appreciate any cooking aid that saves me time.In addition, for my purposes, I have had no problem at all in cleaning this mandoline or with food sticking in it. I simply use my sink sprayer to clean it. As yet, I haven't had a need to use the brush that came with it for cleaning.Although this mandoline may not be good for all slicing needs, it certainly helps a lot in the preparation of salad ingredients. Will this mandoline replace all use of a conventional mandoline, a food processor, or a knife - not likely. They all have their uses, and this mandoline will not replace any of them. Really, the purpose of kitchen gadgets is to make some jobs easier and faster. This mandoline will definitely do that if you make a lot of salads with a lot of ingredients as I do. It will not replace a conventional mandoline that will slice large veggies such as potatoes. Whether this mandoline is useful for you depends on your needs. Personally, for me, it saves a lot of time in cutting veggies I use for salads.UPDATE 02/19/24:I have had this mandoline for 3 years, and it still is as sharp and cuts as well as the day I got it. I use it primarily for slicing veggies for salads which makes it so much easier to make dinner salads almost every night.I grow most of our veggies indoors, and most recently I had to slice a large harvest of carrots before steaming, packaging, and freezing them. Slicing all of the carrots would have been a tedious chore, but, by using this mandoline, I had them all sliced in less than 5 minutes.One thing I have learned is to keep foods packed in the shoot so they don't turn sideways. To do this, I sometimes adjust the orientation of food in the shoot or add more to keep everything upright. As you use this tool, you learn how to keep slices even. Although I use a knife or my larger mandoline for some jobs, this mandoline is still an invaluable tool in my kitchen.I hope this review was helpful for you. I will update my review if my opinion changes or I find more uses for it.Read more"
Smart Kitchen,Cheese Grater with Garlic Crusher- Box Grater Vegetable Shredder with 3 Stainless Steel Blades - Graters for Kitchen- Cheese Graters with Handle - Garlic Mincer Tool and Vegetable Peeler,16.,4.6,"1,777",https://us.amazon.com/dp/B0BP7MD6QB,5.0,"September 20, 2025",5.0 out of 5 starsA great set for the kitchen,"I've had this grater for over a year and it's been very durable and handy.  I don't know why I suffered with an open-ended grater all these years!  It's so much more convenient to have the carrots or cheese or whatever captured in the container until you're ready to add them to your recipe. The rubber bottom keeps the holder from slipping while you grate and the handle is comfortable.  Since the grater detaches from the holder, clean up is a breeze and if you're grating a small amount you can hold the just grater in your hand over wherever it goes and not even have to clean the holder.  The peeler is serious business.  Very sharp and effective.  The garlic crusher is effective, but personally I find it more convenient to just just mince it myself or use a press.  But for larger quantities of garlic, it's handy to have around.  Bon appetit!Read more"

He absolutely loves it.  He doesn't have to drink cold coffee anymore.  You can set the temperature - there's four choices: 131, 145, 167, or 185 degrees.  There's also a timer you can set.  He's been using it for close to a year now, and it's working just fine.  He uses it every day for about five hours a day - even on the weekends.  It's about 1-1/4 inches high and 6-1/2"" (front to back) x 5-1/4"" side to side.  It's a sleek, black, and looks nice on his desk.  This is great for anyone that wants to keep their hot beverage hot.  It's also makes a great gift.Update: adding 2 photos.  I was asked to answer a few questions, but my responses don't get attached to the review, so I'm adding that here as follows:1) The warmer does not appear to be UL certified.  There is no sticker or label on the warmer or cord indicating UL certification (or listing, as per the question).2) Unsure if product contains PTFE or Teflon.  There is nothing on it indicating a yes or a no to either, and I no longer have the box to look at.3) Unsure of where it's made. Nothing on the warmer mentions it, and as stated above, I no longer have the box.4) Yes, it makes a great gift for any occasion.5) It came in a box which made it easy to wrap for Christmas.6) This question disappeared while I was answering another question, so I'll put the question and the answer: ""How do I turn it off? Do I have to use the timer?"" (I took that as being asked if you had to use the timer and wait for the timer to finish to go off.)  There is a power button.

GREAT Vacuum!!!,"Best $150 Ever!!! LOVE this little machine!!!We’ve been using the Eufy for about 3 months now and I’m in love with this product! We have sealed brick floors, two cats and a small dog and live in the desert. Between the dust and the pet hair this vacuum is a godsend. It makes its way through our home, sucking up hair and dirt and dust in ways. I didn’t think was possible by such an affordable machine. It makes its way around table legs under our couch along the walls in and out of rooms and returns home to its base!! So I started in the evening & wake up in the morning and it’s sitting already charged again, ready to go.It runs for about an hour. I’d say before returning to its base. Our house is very long and so the one thing I do is that I shut a couple of the doors that we don’t use a lot so that I can focus on the area as I want.Initially, I had it kind of in a hidden corner location in a small room, but  that did not really work as well. I’ve now moved it in the kitchen where I wanted to focus its energy and things are going great. It returns every night to its recharging after cleaning the majority of the house.Because of the way, our house is laid out and the size I am considering getting another one just for the other end of our house.We bought this when our vacuum died and I haven’t needed to vacuum once since. I’d wanted to get one of these for a long time, but they were so expensive and we did not like the idea of entering a map to our home into a device that was on our Wi-Fi. I love that this does not connect to the Wi-Fi and all you have to do is just simply plug it in and push the power button and it will find its way around the house. I’ve watched it so many times and it does an incredible job Without needing to map our home.There have been a couple times I wanted it to specifically focus on one area and in that case, I simply blocked it from being able to leave or by shutting it in a room or just picking it up turning it around and putting it back.We are extremely happy with this little vacuum! I would buy it again in a minute, and I’m thinking about getting it as a Christmas present.I like that it alerts me if it does get stuck. There have been a couple of times it got lost before I found the right location to house the base, but none of this changes my mind about what a fabulous device it is! If you’re thinking about it, do!!Finally, the noise level is not an issue at all. We live in a very quiet place and it does not bother me at all… I’m just so happy it does such a good job. It makes my life easier!Read more"

House is cleaner because we own it,"We have owned this robot vacuum from February 2025-Sept 2025.I think it is an excellent budget robot vacuum. My kods enjoyed bossing it around with the remote, I managed to set a scheduled vacuuming sometime in the middle of the night, and overall it does a pretty decent job. It gets up a LOT of stuff. I have 4 kids, we homeschool, and we believe in spending lots of time outside (which translates to lots of dirt getting tracked in). Let's be honest: no robot vacuum is going to solve my issues. *However*, every single time I run this guy (we've named him Felix), he gets up all sorts of stuff. I'm talking perler beads, rubber bands, pony beads, lego pieces, and SO much dust and dirt. He does get caught up on stuff. I put our cat's food and water on a 1/2"" tall wooden tray in hopes that Felox would quit trying to get a snack and drink, but he was too rugged and would ""jump the curb"" to get him a piece. Strings, ribbons, pipe cleaners, and socks goon him up. He seems to find the weird places where the furniture is just *slightly* closer to the floor than anywhere else and wedges himself in there and gets stuck, crying out for help. I put things in front of the TV stand now to try and prevent sticking.Pros:- my house is cleaner after Felix does his thing- he doesnt get caught up on a lot (can go over rugs, mats, small toys, etc)- cheap- easy to clean/empty- replacement parts are readily available- not picky about placement on the charging stationCons:- gets stuck on socks/strings- gets stuck, so rarely makes it back to ""base"" to charge. I joke about putting a Tile (airtag for you apple folks) on him so I dont have to search for him- the one spinner is woefully bent out of shape, so I'm ordering replacementsMy husband made fun of me when we bought this because he knows how infrequently my house is picked up enough to run a robot vacuum. However, we've run Felix far more than I've had time to vacuum, and I count it as a net win that my house is cleaner on a more regular basis because he's around.Read more"

Stopped working a little after the return window ended, but customer service was prompt and helpful, and gave me a refund for purchasing a new brush.  Now its working really well.  I used to have a Deebot at home, but moved it to my office.  I have 4 small pets at home, including a long hair cat that sheds like crazy.  Compared to the deebot, this vacuum is much less expensive, doesn't get as much hair stuck in the front wheel or the brushes, isn't self emptying (but I wanted it that way, because I ended up having to manually empty the deebot 80% of the time anyway), and does a much better job at mopping and vacuuming at the same time (in the deebot, the moisture would mix with the dust in the dust chamber, but in the Tikom, the dust chamber is bone dry).  On the other hand, Deebot's app is a lot better, giving you a clearer picture of the what's been vacuumed and what hasn't (it shows you a map of your whole house, and what areas have been finished, and allows you to select specific zones of the house to clean from the complete map, whereas the Tikom only shows you what's been finished, hard to figure out what the image represents without being superimposed on a map of the whole house), and the self-emptying feature works fine in my office, where there's a lot less hair.  The tikom is also takes about twice as long to finish my house.  Still, overall, i'd recommend it if you don't want to spend more than $150Read more"

As an engineer I can easily recognize quality, or lack thereof.  This company has clearly taken the time to built an extremely high-quality, functional robotic vacuum!  It's even evident in their packaging!  The build quality seems second to none.- Mapping capability and algorithm ensures this robot vac covers every square inch of your floor. It even knows if there's a moveable object in the way (e.g. cat) and will later come back to try to get that missed area.  As you can see in my video, it easily maneuvers around furniture and cabinets, all the while keeping track of the areas it's cleaned and hasn't yet cleaned. Lastly, it avoids falling down the stairs since it has a ""cliff"" sensor. My 12 year old found it so intriguing, that he followed it around the house the first time we used it. It truly is mind-blowing how accurately this thing maps / cleans!- Although it has a redundant bump sensor, it's laser technology keeps it from bumping into objects.- I love that it can function as vacuum only, mop only, or both at the same time.  When mopping, it automatically knows to avoid carpeted areas / rugs.- The included App with Wi-Fi connectivity enables remote control through for scheduling and further intricate controls and room mapping capability.- The suction power is very strong and automatically adjusts to the type of flooring the vac is currently cleaning.  As an example, in our living room, it'll increase the suction as it crosses back and forth over our floor rug.- It can easily maneuver over carpeting, thresholds, kitchen mats, etc. without any trouble whatsoever.- 2+ hour battery life lasts long enough to completely vacuum our entire home of 2000 sqft on one charge.  After cleaning (or during cleaning if your home is very large), it automatically finds it's way back to it's home charging dock (full charge took about 3 hours). If needed, after charging, it will return to the spot it last left off to complete the cleaning.- Once vacuuming is complete and it returns to it's home charging dock, it also empties it's canister into the charging dock's dust bag.  I expect for the bag to last months before needing to be replaced (1 replacement included).If you are looking for a top-of-the-line robotic vacuum, don't hesitate to purchase this one!!NOTE: Certain parts of the video are sped up 2x.Read more"

I have stairs, and it reliably avoids them without getting stuck or needing intervention. The app is also really useful — it shows a clear map of where the vacuum has cleaned, and setting up scheduled cleanings through the app is super easy. I’ve set it to clean automatically in the mornings, and it’s been running like clockwork.The self-emptying dock is another huge plus.

However, IT WORKS VERY WELL!!The app works well on my Android phone, After I followed the download and installations directions Completely and enabled LOCATION (which I Never do) after which the machine found the phone and they had a little chat.Neither Wi-Fi  nor the app is strictly necessary for this to clean your house, but only to program cleaning areas and schedules. For example, before I got it to pair with my phone, after charging completely of course, I simply turned it on to see what it would do.First it got its bearings, spinning a couple times, located the dock, kissed it just to make sure, and then started cleaning my wood floors; All of them! It found its way around the dining table/chairs, didn't get stuck under the wood rocking chair, cleaned the area rug in the living room Just Fine, wandered into every room and did a Very Good Job of cleaning, even the back hall by the back door! It even found a little pile of course sand in husband's room and got it all (I wouldn't recommend feeding it sand deliberately. I don't think it was happy with that!) I was quite astonished how much hair and lint it picked up!There are things it can't do; toe-kicks for example as it's too tall to get into most of them.  And being Round, it has a bit of trouble with some tight corners., and some edges at interface of floor and wall. Some of these places might need Human Intervention, such as in a broom or small hand brush.It can't really do a good job plush pile carpet if it's very dirty. It simply lacks the power and heavy beater bar of a monstrous upright. (But it doesn't claim to compete with those.) [EDIT] So I cleaned  mine Really well with the upright monster to give the Shark a head start, and it worked very well. After a couple weeks of Matrix Clean every couple days it's even begun to lift the pile in high traffic areas,. Today for example, the carpet hasn't looked this good in Years!![/Edit]There is a setting in the App to allow it to return to the dock to recharge and resume cleaning, and one to empty itself and resume. What a Good Idea! I recommend that one for sure.I would Highly recommend this machine for Anyone, not merely for an elderly person. The Entertainment Value alone is worth what it cost me, not to mention the time saving issue.This Robot is nothing sort of Brilliant!Just Brilliant!**Read more"

We previously owned a model from a different maker, but that one was a simple ""bump"" style that we had tired of over the last couple years.  We wanted to try a smarter type that could also self-clean, so when this popped up on offer we took a chance and bought it.We have three large dogs that constantly shed, as well as two cats; all are inside pets.  We have hardwood floors throughout the house except for the bedrooms, so the plan was for this little guy to handle the hardwood floors while we vacuum the carpets with a standard vacuum cleaner.  I haven't had the chance to do an actual mapping run of the house because we are still in the process of moving in and there are boxes and other items in various areas that haven't been put away.  I've only let the little fella roam on his own without mapping, but I hope to have everything put away (or mostly put away) by the end of the year.So far our little robot has done a great job on the hardwood floors.  He picks up way more than the other robot vacuum ever did.  It's amazing to watch it dock and empty itself into the base station, then get back to work all on its own.  One great feature is how it cleans the brush roller.  I'm not sure how it does it, but it does a great job.  It does leave some hairs behind on the roller right in the middle when the metal support lies on the brush cover, as well as at the edges of the brush where it attaches to the motor.  I wasn't surprise by that and it should be expected since those areas aren't easy to access without removing the cover and brush roll from the machine.  The hairs came off super easy by hand, though.  It was far easier to remove them than with the other vacuum robot we owned.The base station holding tank would probably last 30 days in houses without pets, or with one small pet; however, with our 5 pets it filled up within a few days of running 1-2 times per day.  I checked it after about 6-8 days of running and it was quite full.  It might have been able to run for another day or two (maybe longer), but I didn't want to risk it and was already heading to the rubbish bin anyway, so I went ahead and emptied it.The one frustrating thing I've found so far is the tall foam filter in the base dumps dirt out when you lift it out to clean it.  I discovered that when I was emptying the base for the first time and decided to pull that out to give it a quick clean.  Fine dirt just kept dropping out of it while I walked to the front door, leaving a trail of dirt behind.  Now I know to only remove that when either outside or above the trash, both of which require lifting the base and taking it somewhere else.  I can live with that slight inconvenience since the robot does so much work for me otherwise.Overall I am very pleased with the purchase.  I suppose there are more expensive options out there, but this one is fine for our needs.  I MIGHT update this review once I have the little guy map the house and start doing fully automated runs.Read more"

We live in a 1300 sq ft single story home in AZ, tile floors & area rugs. One small dog, no kids. Vacuuming and traditional mopping every other week was just spreading dirty water. I looked at a Hoover and Bissell but didn't want to push around both a vacuum and an electric mop. Then I looked at the i5 and 105 combos but they didn't seem like they'd be any better than a Swiffer pad. If I was going to spring for a Roomba, I wanted it to really mop the floors.I grabbed the 405 Combo during Prime Days and it's been worth every penny. The machine was easy to unpack & assemble and the app was easy to use. You just have to read the instructions. The 405 quickly mapped out our home, and I could easily divide the map into rooms, name them and define ""keep out"" areas. Cleaning starts with selecting the area/rooms and a touch of a button in the app (or asking Alexa to tell the Roomba to clean whatever room I want it to).I can set up ""routines"" in the app to schedule vacuuming and/or mopping at specific times on certain days. We've been scheduling the 405 to vacuum & mop the kitchen, entry & hall (high traffic area) at 5 am twice a week. It is a vacuum cleaner, so of course we hear it. But not as much as my Dyson. We're waking up anyway so we just close the bedroom door while it heads to the kitchen on the other side of the house. It's refreshing to get up to clean floors.I love that the 405 does all the work. All I have to do is fill/empty the water tanks (we use the Roomba cleaning solution). The home base empties the dust bin, washes the mop pads then recharges for the next cleaning. The iRobot easily cleans our whole home without recharging. It only returns to the base to rewet the mop pads when it needs to. The tank is at the base, rather than in the iRobot. The app monitors the ""life"" of the edge brush, mop pads, roller brush & filter, and how full the dust bag is. I don't expect to need to replace anything for 3 months.This has totally been worth the investment. Now if it could just dust the furniture and clean the toilet...Read more"

Little did I know instructions aren’t needed as the Roomba sets itself up through the app. It mapped my home within minutes without having to investigate the entire perimeter. The first cycle was a “standard“ vac and mop. The Roomba performed well, especially the vacuum, which did a thorough job vacuuming the cat hair, scattered litter, sand, and dust created by the resident felines. Them mopped did a good job although I did notice that some residue from the tougher spots remained after the cycle. Next, I’ll try those deep clean option to see how it does. Other than that, the Roomba is very easy to use – you tell it what to do and it does it, including returning to the base to charge if needed and to empty the dirty mop water. It even cleans and dries them mop pads after use. I definitely recommend for maintaining a generally clean home and look forward to learning what else it can do.Read more"

Best floor-cleaning helper ever!I bought this Roomba to help with the chore I like the least – mopping. First, I did a little research, and I decided to spend a little more on this model because I liked the spinning mop pads, figuring they would do a better job scrubbing my floors to my satisfaction. Plus, the auto-washing base is magical and a must-have. It takes care of refreshing the mop pads while it’s cleaning so it’s not continually mopping with gross, dirty pads. And when it’s all done, it will wash and dry them too! No need for me to do it! The base also runs a self-cleaning cycle, that way it doesn’t get musky or mildewy. It’s pretty much a hands-free system. All I do is fill the water tank when needed and empty the dirty when it gets full. Easy-peasy.I can set up a cleaning schedule, but mostly I just start cleaning from the app, or use voice commands. I found everything very easy to set up. It literally mapped my home in minutes and was ready to go!Overall, I’m very impressed with how well it cleans. The vacuum takes care of all those little fluffies and hairs and little bits on the day-to-day. It automatically boosts power on the carpet by my entrance and will lift the pads in the back, so nothing gets wet. The robot will also empty itself into the base for months before I’ll need to worry about removing the bag.The only hiccups I’ve had were when it sucked up my bathmat and got stuck. I got an alert on the app. I know now that it’s too light and I’ll need to put it up from now on. It also got too close to some power cords under my entertainment unit. However, the app lets you create Keep Out zones, so once I placed one over the area I wanted it to stay out, and haven’t had any problems since.Roomba saves me so much time fussing with my floors. It’s only been a short time but I’m very pleased with the performance. When I come home it feels fresh and clean. It’s a relief to not worry about running a vacuum or dragging out the mop because it’s already taken care of.Read more"

I just didn’t want to vacuum but I wanted clean floors.  Over the years I’ve never had to because this thing is able to work 24/7 and while this thing isn’t a A+ student in the precision department.  (It will wander everywhere) The little guy WILL wander everywhere and through persistent work just clean everything, pull hair, dust and debris I didn’t even see out of god knows where.It has been doing this since November 2017, and it’s had a good run.  It is t dead, no.  It “should” be dead, in the years I’ve had to replace the main brush guard twice, the main brush itself three times, the side brushes once or twice each, the battery and finally the left wheel (it gave out recently) and I was able to order replacement parts on amazon for less than 35$ each.I’ve learned how to (not recommended by the manufacturer) tear this thing down safely and clean it and give it the TLC it needs, it kinda has become the equivalent of an old favorite car or bike that you just know inside and out.In its current last act it is helping as valiantly as it can to keep the flea population as low as possible (cat decided to bring friends inside and I am working furiously to keep from becoming a snack each time I sleep, putting everything through the washer, and cleaning and spraying (it’s going well).  This roomba in its own would pick up a flea (which while it isn’t much in flea numbers just makes me feel more attached to this little guy).So I decided to get clever, (another process probably not recommended by the manufacturer coming btw) and out some quick drying adult, larvae and flea egg killer that lingers at the bottom of the dust collector.... let it dry and turned it on.It has been fighting its war in fleas much more effectively.  Found two more on its first run and a third on its next.  Running it again.So I recommend you do this?  Nope!  What I’m saying is this little guy has been going on for several years, has been bumped, battered and had parts broken on it and it is still running.  I’ve had manual vacuums last less... and do less, although I’ve had them do more and last longer too.  The main benefit of this roomba is that if you get to know it carefully and learn how to replace parts and keep it clean it can be your best friend if you like a clean house and hate bugs!The reason I am writing this review is because I’m waiting on another roomba (the a9 version of this one).  Will I stop using the a4s?  Nah, it will just be retired to cleaning my room only while the new kid on the block tackles the whole house.If you’ve made it this far I fully can recommend this roomba new and from the manufacturer (get it while you can!) and have had absolutely no regrets because this is probably the most sturdy roomba that is keeping a house clean that has three people with long hair, and three cats to keep up with.If you have any questions, feel free to ask.  Can’t guarentee a quick response (I work like everyone else) but I’ll try and answer when I am able.Read more"

It has vacuumed my house every day, without fail, since April 19th. The ONLY problems that we have had are human error issues. Like, once when we had company, they didn't realize they had to pick up all cables and chargers. The vac ate a computer cord and shut down while we were gone. Did no damage to the vac. Only other issue was getting wedged between a high kitchen mat at the bottom of the cabinet. We now pick up the mat for the vacuum. Our house has hardwood floors, a pretty open layout, and usually doesn't have much on the floor anyway so the vac only needs a door or 2 shut and to be emptied each day. We have a med hair dog and he puts out A LOT of hair so we empty the vac daily. Before this vac, I had to pull out my shop vac every day or every other day to vacuum. This little thing has completely put my shop vac out of commission and now I only use this vac and occasionally use my Electrolux handheld vac for spot cleaning.I am amazed at how much dust gets collected on a daily basis!! This thing really can get every little thing. It gets the edges really well in edge cleaning mode and, even though it takes random paths, cleans 95% of my floor when it runs. Hard to reach corners and in between furniture is the only places it doesn't reach well, but I just use another small vac to hit those spaces.Battery Life/Running time is AMAZING!  I would say that I get exactly 2.5 hours on regular mode and about 1.5 hours on max mode. 90% of the time, it runs in regular mode and I have to send it home after about 2 hours because it has covered most all areas and I don't see the need to let it run for no reason. I usually have it set to run while we are gone, and it will run until low battery then. I've been home more than usual lately and have had a chance to time it on running and watch it more and it really does a great job cleaning my floors.The only cons I can come up with at this time is, small canister size, it started giving a slight ""squeaking"" sound during some turns after about a week but nothing that is bothersome, I wish it wasn't so random and had a more set path abilities (I do understand that feature is available with more expensive models).Other than that, I only have one tip for cleaning the canister filter daily.  I take a small hand broom with me out to my porch and turn on a small fan. Stand in front of the fan and ""brush"" off the filter after you empty the canister. Works great and I only have to take apart the filter every week or so and it stays very clean.Update: 6/26/17In the original review, I stated that the battery life was around 2.5 hours in regular mode. In 1 month that has gone down to 2 hours exactly on regular mode. I am going to try replacing the filters and see if the battery life improves any. But, if this keeps up, in a few months, it will not run for very long at all. :(Read more"

On an average it takes 20 minutes to clean a 250sft bedroom ( just a estimate) and the end of it the room was quite clean ( verified by using actual vacuum cleaner).As expected we need to primer the room by clearing the room from all big objects (like toys, pens, etc) before you run the bot ( it did pick up some chalks from under the bed which my girl lost 3 months ago 😀.The bot does require some attention like cleaning the brushes after every round of cleaning and emptying the bags but this is least I could do for a clean room.Moving from one room to another was not consistent but I prefer putting the bot in one room with closed doors and allow it to do magic for about 20 min before moving it to the next room.For now 5 stars will revisit this comment in a few weeks and actual usageRead more"

It does everything it needs to in keeping your floor clean. Very easy to use and setup, I like the auto detergent feature. It's missing features from other flagships, like being able to access the camera, being able to run mop-only jobs or vacuum-then-mop jobs which I would really like to see added in the future. I have  very pet hair friendly home and it's had no issue keeping up with that. No clogs or to speak of so far. I did have some dog fluff get tangled in the extendable brush arm but it was easy enough to remove. Obstacle avoidance is okay, it sees larger objects and avoids them. It pulled the cable out of my electric couch which was probably hard to see as it was black against a dark floor, other cables it avoided well. It's navigated under chairs and tables which was a pain point on previous vacs, that was really good to see. It got stuck on a coat rack leg which was odd but again not a big deal. Overall I'm very happy with its performance, no hair tangles on the brush roller, uses mopping water efficiently. Area's of improvement will likely come in later revisions such as better cameras/obstacle avoidances, more mopping pressure, etc. Overall, I'm very pleased with it and think its one of the best options for your money in the sub $1000 price point.Read more"

After living with the S1 Pro (which mostly just redistributed pet fur into new and interesting shapes and left mopping streaks on the floor), the E25 rolled in like a tiny, self-assured general and took charge.The suction power? Unreal. It doesn’t merely pick up fur — it vanquishes it. My Golden Retriever sheds like he’s auditioning for “Biggest Blizzard in Texas,” and my long haired cat treats every surface like a personal grooming station. The E25 doesn’t care — it tackles it all without hesitation. After its first run, I looked at the full dust bag and thought, “That’s… an entire golden retriever.”And speaking of bags — I love that this model uses easily replaceable dust bags instead of a messy canister. No puff of fur in the air, no awkward tapping over the trash can while muttering regrets. Just pop out the old bag, pop in a new one, and you’re back in business. Clean, fast, satisfying.The controls are simple and intuitive (even pre-coffee me can start a run), and the battery life is impressive — it doesn’t clean the whole house on one charge but it reliably returns home to recharge and continue on.The navigation is reliable and surprisingly smart — though every now and then, the side brush gets a little too ambitious. Mine once tried to “clean” my dining room curtains with the confidence of a toddler holding a leaf blower. Points for enthusiasm, but boundaries are still a work in progress. Eufy 1- Curtains 0Compared to the S1 Pro, the E25 is leagues ahead — stronger suction, better fur management, more consistent cleaning paths, and fewer “existential pauses” that lead to a dead battery and a robot that is MIA.In short: the Eufy E25 is the best robot vacuum-mop I have owned.  It is truly the housework helper you don’t know you need. It’s powerful, reliable, and just the right amount of dramatic. Four plus stars — and a gentle reminder to keep your curtains tucked safely out of its reach. 🐾💨🧡Read more"

While I won’t cover all the differences here, focusing mainly on my experience with this robot, I will reference others to share some personal experiences. It’s important to note that no single vacuum robot with mopping will meet everyone’s needs 100% in all areas (like thresholds between rooms, low furniture, etc.), so it’s essential to research and find one that fits your specific requirements.First, I must say that compared to the three other robots I have used previously—Ecovacs T50 Pro (cleans well and fits under all my furniture but has some quirks), Lefant M3 Max (a good value but limited in advanced features), and Roomba 105 combo (does a good job for its class but requires frequent user intervention)—this one has noticeably better overall build quality. I also appreciate how the base is designed with top water inlet and outlet ports to prevent leaks.Setting up this robot vacuum was incredibly easy. Right at the top of the box, you’ll find a piece of cardboard with step-by-step instructions and a scan code to download the app. Installing the app was simple, much like others I’ve used before. After creating an account and logging in, the app guides you through connecting the robot to your home Wi-Fi (supports 2.4 GHz only for better range and fewer dead spots under beds or in corners). Like all the other robots, there’s a firmware update that takes about 10 minutes to complete, and there is an option to have those apply automatically ensuring future performance improvements. Once that’s done, you can start mapping, setting cleaning tasks, and creating schedules. I especially appreciate how the app lets you save cleaning tasks as scheduled jobs or reusable scenarios instead of needing to make those separately.This robot has really impressed me. It performed excellently in all my tests with cords and small objects in its path and regular cleaning tasks. Like other robots I’ve used, it occasionally struggles with rugs that aren’t tacked down, but this one is the least likely to pull them up and has never gotten stuck like the others. Its solid build quality means I barely hear the wheels, except when going over transitions (no issues with the highest transition in my home, nearly 0.25 inches), and it’s one of the quietest vacuums I’ve used while set at its maximum suction power. While it takes longer to clean my floors compared to doing it manually, it finishes cleaning faster than my other robots did. I also love that it gets into tight spaces between furniture (just enough room for it to fit) when there are no obstacles there while the AI obstacle avoidance is on, unlike others like Ecovacs, which would skip those tighter spots with its AI avoidance turned on. It even strategically reaches areas it can’t fully enter due to height or width clearance, using its side brushes to pull out dirt and dust. Although it doesn’t have an extending mop to reach right against wall edges like some others, it gets close enough, and I prefer its mop design. Most extending mops in this class tend to leak water, creating more mess around walls (as noted in many reviews). I’ve had no water leakage issues with this robot, and there are never any small water drops left behind. (With the Ecovacs T50 Pro, I constantly found water drops throughout my home after mopping.)While it doesn't achieve perfect edge-to-edge mopping, I am overall very satisfied with its cleaning performance. The local AI obstacle avoidance is excellent (unlike some brands that rely on online data), and the side brushes typically get within an inch of objects like cables and clothing, provided there's enough space to navigate, but not always. (it won't always get as close to some objects as I would like it to, such as in my sons room it avoids almost 5 inches of flooring because of a cord running along the baseboard). The mopping performance is superb, effectively cleaning stains, and the application coding is outstanding. Although the T50 fits under more furniture, I actually prefer using this robot and am considering higher couch legs or furniture risers because of its exceptional unattended performance. I would definitely recommend this robot, especially when it's on sale for just over $1000.00. It is a 4.5 for me and I am rounding up on the rating. (Adding edge to edge mopping, if that could accomplished on a furture model with an extending mop that does not leak would put this robot to a perfect 5 for me, for its build quality value and class.)Some tips to get the most out of your robot vacuum with a mop:- If you have multiple pets, set the robot to empty its bin more frequently to prevent clogs. The app offers useful features for customizing room divisions, cleaning orders, and timing between bin emptying. (This model excels by using total run vacuum time instead of just per-job time.)- For heavily soiled floors, run the mop on full water a couple of times, then switch to medium or low for regular cleaning cycles. While streaking may occur initially, consistent use will eliminate streaks over time. (It mops exceptionally well—better and faster than others I’ve tried.)- Schedule weekly or monthly clean-ups to clear clutter. While the obstacle avoidance is impressive, it won’t perfectly navigate or mop right up to objects without a rear camera for precise reversing.These robots are designed to handle most daily cleaning tasks and save time but aren’t flawless. Adding features like a 360 camera, lidar, and extendable arms would significantly increase both size and cost. For their intended purpose and compact size, this model performs exceptionally well at a fair price.NOTE: For those who may have heard about leaking issues, as of the end of July 2025, the leaking issue with the original Eufy E25's dirty water tank has been addressed by Eufy through this upgraded version with new components, including a new rubber seal. I also read that the company is now shipping these updated tanks with new orders, or providing them for free to existing customers experiencing problems with the older versions.Read more"

It's hard to explain or even film to understand. I don't want to name the others because they have fantastic products as well, but here is a test I ran, for example, after I noticed how confident eufy's robot was in moving around my home.I sent the competition to a room to clean a set spot. Mop, vac, and return to base. I then sent the e25 to do the same thing, and it won by over 4 to 5 minutes. Granted, navigating our smaller place is challenging. What I've noticed is that the competition thinks too much when going over the carpet it needs to cross to reach the room. The E25 just says hold my beer and goes as if nothing was there. It's a high pile carpet.Both mop similar to each other, but I find the E25 takes its turns tighter and moves faster as well.The app is simple and easy to use. I've never had the pleasure of testing Eufy robots until recently, and there is a reason this one is still set up because it's become my favorite of the bunch. The mop unfortunately doesn't lift enough, though, to avoid touching the high pile carpet, so keep that in mind. I wish Eufy had gone with a similar design to the other one I use that covers the roller.For the price, if someone were to ask me price to value, I'd recommend this all day, every day. I'm going with 4 star because they did not explain to customers what exactly is upgraded or different from the original.Read more"

I can work on stuff with it in the room and it does not bother me at all (my dog also does not mind it).-works great on white carpet and easily transitions from my living room to dining room (which has a slight bump).-when its low on battery, it does not die where it is at, it just turns off the vacuum then finds the home doc and charges itself.-just works really well. I run it everyday and I am impressed by how much stuff it gets (especially when it goes under things such as the couch).-if it gets caught on a cord, it usually takes 5-10 seconds but then it stops the suctioning and moves away (releasing the cord or other item). However if you have a small cord you should put it up (and you should regardless, I just noticed it doing this a few times and thought it was neat, but I do try to pick up all cords).What could be improved:-nothing really in particular to this.-It does not work well on anything black, but this is true for all robot vacuums. It sometimes gets stuck when it goes on the black carpet we have with the black chairs (I suspect because it can not detect them), but this has not happened often. My dog has a black mat for her food and water and it always bumps into it and spills the water, but again, this would occur with any robot vacuum.-Also, make sure the doc is against a wall because otherwise it will move and never charge (self explanatory, but I did not do the first time and it kept trying to doc and was just pushing the doc around the floor).-Finally, you do have to dump out the vacuum particles almost every time you run it (if you do a full circle/battery cycle). It is really easy to dump and beeps when it needs to be emptied. Again, nothing really negative, just something to note.Overall, I really like this! It does a nice job cleaning up the dog hair and other things that get on my floor and saves me a lot of time not vacuuming daily. If you have a dog, I would watch them with this first before you use it. My dog was initially scared of it but sniffed it's ""butt"" and now they are cool and she does not mind it at all. Pleased with this product and would recommend! :)**UPDATE**On another note, Eufy has amazing customer service!

My last Roomba bit the dust this month, and I did a ton of research before buying a replacement. I went with the Eufy for a few reasons: price point, cleaning power, quietness, and sleek design.Price: Very reasonable. Almost reasonable enough that I'd consider getting another one for my second floor. For now I'll just carry it upstairs.Cleaning power: This thing sucks... It's suction is much stronger than my Roombas have had. It picks up so much dust and pet hair. We do a full vacuum every other week with my Dyson, so I think of the robot vacuum as a supplemental vacuum. I was shocked at how much was in the dustbin after it's inaugural cleaning! The picture attached to this is from that cleaning. It also gets a ton of dust in the little dust filter. In one of the video reviews I watched, the reviewer said it didn't pick up anything in that dust filter... So maybe my carpet is particularly dusty, because it has a thick layer after each cleaning.Quietness: I work from my home office, and this thing is quiet enough that I don't even turn it off during conference calls. This might be the thing I am most impressed with. My last Roomba was LOUD-- you couldn't even have a conversation with someone in the same room, let alone someone on speakerphone.Sleek design: I love/hate this. It definitely looks modern and cool, and more like an art piece than an appliance, but it shows all my finger prints, and now I keep a glasses cleaning cloth nearby so I can rub it down. I suppose if I only use the remote and never pick it up, this won't be an issue.A few considerations: I was hoping to find a robot vacuum that wouldn't eat my carpets' tassels, but I don't think that vacuum exists. I have only used the Eufy 4 times so far, and it doesn't always get its brushes wrapped around the long tassels, but it does sometimes. It seems to realize it sooner than my Roomba did at least. The Roomba would sometimes rip gobs of them off in a single cleaning. I try to tuck them under the edge of the rug and that doesn't seem to bother Eufy. It has pulled off probably 2 tassels so far.The cleaning pattern seems pretty random. I saw some other vacuums that chart out complex maps of your home, and Eufy doesn't seem to do that. But, it doesn't seem to matter, because it still hits every spot in the rooms.I'm a little concerned about durability. My Roombas ran for many, many years with easily replaceable parts. We'll have to see if Eufy has the same longevity.All in all- I'm very happy with my purchase and definitely recommend it!Read more"

As for this one, which I bought, the story is a bit different. First time I used it, I only vacuumed. That worked very well and I had no issues. On Sunday I decided to vacuum/mop. The dirty water tank has an issue. How do I know? Well, there was a mini flood around the machine because the dirty water from the mops wasn't being sucked up into the dirty water tank. Also, after a certain amount of water that leaked, it stopped working. I was going to call customer service on Monday, but since Eufy is connected to my Eufy phone app, the company had already contacted me that same morning, to say they are sending me a free dirty tank exchange, since they have had the same issue with others. Hence this is apparently a common problem. The exchange, according to the customer service office, will be in 4 to 5 weeks. Although I am thankful that they are doing this gratis, and recognize that their item has an issue, if they are aware of the issue, why not fix the item before selling it? Also, 4 to 5 weeks??? That is a long time. I am now awaiting the new dirty water tank. I will keep you posted.Read more"

It was the first generation who could empty themselves and was responsible for taking care of the most extensive square footage of our home (the main floor). As we tried to find parts to repair it, fur was getting out of hand in our household. Unable to take it any longer, we upgraded to the new AI vacuum with a larger dumping bin. Honestly, we are so glad we did since it has been truly night and day!The new Shark Matrix was very easy to set up out of the box. The bin was together, mostly just getting protective wrapping off the vacuum. From there, it was just waiting for it to charge. Getting it on the app was just scan and go, with the hardest part being deciding what to name our vacuum. After a good twelve-hour charge (we had it charging while we were working and taking care of dinner), we had to do its first sweep of the house, mostly just mapping its new territory. It had a very detailed map on the first try, something our old vacuum had never really accomplished.What was really impressive, however, was the vacuuming itself. The next day, we let it go on its first true expedition. Unlike our old one, we still have not seen an error, and it has taken care of itself, even with large tufts of dog fur (we have two double-coated Alaskan Malamutes in full shed). It just didn't care. It took care of everything, emptied itself, and had no clogs! It even had an even better map after working and sent us complete statistics of its work.We are so glad we got this vacuum and are pleased with how it has cleaned and handled large amounts of dog fur. If you have a double-coated dog and want to make life easier, get this vacuum!Read more"

Robot Vacuums,"Shark AI Ultra Voice Control Robot Vacuum with Matrix Clean Navigation, Home Mapping, 60-Day Capacity, XL Self-Empty Base for Homes with Pets, Carpet & Hard Floors, Cool Grey",399.,4.1,"34,781",https://us.amazon.com/dp/B09T4YZGQR,3.0,"December 5, 2019",3.0 out of 5 starsWorks well except vacuuming gets slightly better every day.,"The media could not be loaded.Update 8:My robot has developed a leg fetish (see video), can someone recommend a good therapist for robots?Update 7:Cleans well except for any of the following when 1/4"" to 1/2"" long: thread, yarn, Doritos, felt, etc. I think it just needs a better brush. I'd trade the current tangle resistance brush for a brush that helped clean better any day. It is fun at parties though: Guest 1 drops a Dorito; Guest 2 steps on Dorito; I call: ""Alexa, tell Shark to clean dining room""; Guests laugh hysterically as Shark IQ drives over Dorito fragments leaving them undisturbed.Update 6:When you press the Play (labeled Clean) button in the Shark app, if you pick the option to clean up to 3 specific rooms, you cannot clean the last room entered on the map, it won't let you scroll that far (they put the button over that option) so you can scroll it into view but you can't hold the scroll position in view with one finger while clicking the option with the other, if you let go of the position to click the option it goes back behind the button so you cannot click it.  So make sure the last thing you add to the map is a no-go area so that all of the other rooms are options when sending Shark to clean manually (you can always clean the ""hidden"" room via Alexa though).Update 5:Mapping has completed.  Labeling rooms is not intuitive, after you add each room, it makes you rename all of the previous rooms you already defined and labeled as follows: Define room 1, give it a name, define room 2, give room 1 a name, give room 2 a name, define room 3, give room 1 a name, give room 2 a name, give room 3 a name ...  So I have my rooms defined, I have one Shark IQ set up, I can send my Shark to clean a specific room as follows (paraphrasing because I don't remember the exact wording): Me: ""Alexa, ask Shark to clean the Family Room."" Alexa: ""Which Shark vacuum would you like me to use?"" Me: ""Shark"".  That's right, I have one Shark and I named it Shark, but every time I tell Alexa to do something with my Shark, it asks me to pick a Shark out of the following set of Sharks: [Shark].  Shark app will not let you schedule cleaning of a room or a set of rooms.  You can schedule when to clean everything, you can't schedule when to clean something.  I want Shark to start cleaning after everyone has left for school and work, and I want it to finish before anyone gets back.  Unfortunately, because it takes about 2.5 hours to clean my house, between, emptying and charging it finishes around 6 pm. We start getting home from work and school around 2 pm.  So, I tried scheduling rooms through Alexa Routines.  The only way you can schedule the Shark skill in Alexa is to schedule Alexa to ask you what you want the Shark to do.  I tried using Google Assistant as outlined in the documentation found in the Shark app but Google Assistant can't find the Shark ROBOT service as described in the Shark IQ documentation.  But I was able to schedule cleaning of 3 rooms a day so that the robot is always dormant while we are at home and every room gets cleaned every 24 hours:  I used Google Assistant Routines to have Google Assistant tell Alexa what to tell the Shark to do, it works flawlessly.  The hard part was setting up 10 ""Say something"" commands for each schedule: First ""Say  something"" command tells Alexa which room needs to be vacuumed, the next 8 ""Say something"" commands in each Routine I put four spaces in (not sure if quantity matters) that pause Google Assistant long enough for Alexa to ask which of my one robots I want it to use, and the last Say command says: ""Shark"".  So to schedule my Shark IQ to clean specific rooms at specific times on specific days I put a Google Mini next to an Echo Dot and the Google Assistant takes care of the schedule, the Google Mini tells the Echo Dot what to do, the Echo Dot then tells the Shark what to do. Rube Goldberg would be proud.Update 4:Scheduled runs often fail complaining: ""... cannot run because its dust cup is missing.""So I may need to find the dust bin sensor and hard wire it to always report present since it often reports missing even though dust bin is properly inserted and latched. The only time I have ever removed the dust bin was to clear dust cup error.Update 3:New firmware today: V3.4.11-20191015V3.6.18-m149-Oct 26 2019MesaM1.8.20MesaB0.1.1S2.0.107 I wish they would publish change logs.Update 2:This is what I want before I give this product 5 stars (some of these features probably already exist for this product already but won't be enabled until mapping is complete):1. Ability to get rid of BotBoundaries and instead draw boundaries on map.2. Ability to give robot verbal hints about where a new dry spill is as in: Alexa, tell Shark to clean Kitchen Southwest. What I'd like that to do is imagine that each room has 9 dots: NW, N, NE, W, Center, E, SW, S, SE. Center is default.  When you send it to a room it starts at the dot specified where W and E caused it to clean a third of the room first traveling N to S and S to N, N and S cleans a third traveling W to E and E to W, and NW, NE, SW, and SE start by cleaning a quarter of the room and sending to the center cleans third of the room first either traveling N to S or W to E, whatever it normally does when cleaning the whole floor. This way when you want to clean up a spill of dry goods you can send it to the point of nine closest to the spill in that room to start.3. Ability to see location of robot on map in app. Helpful when you need to find robot for any reason but you can't hear in stereo. For me, using the existing find robot feature is like playing the game hotter colder as it only tells me if I'm getting closer or not each time it plays sound because I can't hear in stereo.Update 1:After I wrote my original review I noticed that the cleaning history was updating but the app said that it couldn't connect to my Shark. So I now think that there really was just an issue with Shark's servers. Day 1, no connectivity issues. Day after posting my review: no connectivity issues. The Shark has cleaned my house 25 times but says map is only 40% complete. The incomplete map that it won't let me edit yet looks 100% accurate and 100% complete. So I'm raising my rating from 1 star to 4 stars instead of 5. Next week if mapping still isn't finished I'll lower it to 2. After mapping is complete and I've been able to test all the features I might raise rating to five stars. So far, it has cleaned house well on schedule, alerts me at work when it gets stuck (now averages getting stuck less than once a day) so I can send one of my kids to get it up and running again. I wish it came with three times as much BotBoundary.Original:As soon as it installed firmware version V3.4.10-20190826V3.6.15-1321-Aug 27 2019MesaM1.8.2MesaB0.1.1S2.0.102 it could no longer stay connected to WiFi, so to control this vacuum by smartphone or voice you need a WiFi robot capable of turning the Shark IQ RV1001AE off, waiting 10 seconds, then turning it back on.  I have two subnets/SSIDs, one mesh (Google WiFi), one not (Google Fiber's Built in WiFi).  None of my other wifi devices at home have any trouble staying connected to either network.  I've tried my Shark on both since the firmware upgrade, it disconnects from both.  So it can still vacuum the whole house on a schedule, returning to base to empty and to charge on it's own.  I just don't get notifications when it gets stuck, and I can't send it to go clean a specific room in my house without first walking over to the charging base, turning the vacuum off, waiting a few seconds, and then turning it back on.  If the noisy vacuum interrupts a conversation, I can't pause it with my phone, I have to get up and press the Dock button or turn it off.  Also, when it gets stuck, it usually gets stuck right when it starts working as one of it's wheels will slide off the side of the charging base ramp pad and somehow get stuck on the of the pad with the stuck wheel on the carpet but the ribbed side of the wheel stuck on the corner of the ramp.Read more"

I’ve had other smart vacuums before, but never felt like the functionality matched what the capabilities promised. The smart mapping was super quick and accurate. I know it’s frustrating to feel like a product needs more setup than just a plug and play, but taking a bit of time on the front end will yield some really great results. Some of my favorite features so far are the ability to clean a specific room, as well as mark off areas to stay away. We have long drapes in a couple areas that for previous models we had to ties up for cleaning, but now I’ve simply added a small box on the map as a no-go zone. So simple, but makes a big difference. The suction is great as well, it’s done a great job sweeping up everything from scraps from the kids crafts to stuffing from our dog toys and just regular dust that accumulates. It’s nice that the bin empties on its own. I am a bit concerned how often we’ll need to swap out the bag, but certainly less frequently than needing to empty the on board bin manually each time. The app was also really easy to set up and very intuitive. The only main feature I’ve not really attempted is the mopping function. At the end of the day I’m not looking for that type of feature as we’ve got a mix of carpet and hardwood. I highly recommend this model for anyone considering a good valued smart vacuum, it will absolutely save time and help maintain your home conveniently.Read more"

This is our first robot vacuum and we didn't know what to expect. So far we have been very impressed with how well it has worked. It was packaged very well and I loved came with a quick user guide (see images). The directions were very easy to follow. I thought it would be hard to set up but you literally push one button and it goes around your house, creates a map of your house and separates each room by different colors (see picture attached). It was very easy to set up. The app is also very user friendly. We currently have the vacuum set up to clean each room at separate times of the day due to our kids going to bed at different times. I have heard stories about people's robot vacuums getting stuck all the time and that being frustrating. So far it has only gotten stuck once because it sucked up a cord that we forgot to clean up. We were using the charger/dust collector at the beginning but it was pretty loud so we set it up through the app for us to manual remove the dust. It is also nice to see what it picked up because my kids like to leave small Legos throughout the house. It has never ran out of batteries and the mopping part works well too. We mop a couple of times a week with it. It won't mop things that are stuck to the ground but will pick up anything loose on the ground. So far we am very impressed by how well it works. We currently have it set up to clean each day and when I clean the dust collector it is full each time so I know it is working. If you are looking for a budget friendly vacuum that works very well, we definitely recommend this.Read more"

Last month I saw this model at 57% off during Amazon Prime days so I bought it.  It's been almost a month and my husband now admits he was wrong and that this was money very well spent.We found the room mapping to be simple and thorough.  We use this only on our ceramic tile and wood laminate floors and we find the vacuum does a great job of picking up crumbs, dirt and even the cat hair.  I love that you can choose to clean one area or the whole house.  We sweep every day and mop every other day doing a Matrix Clean rotating between the Kitchen, Dining Room and Living Room.  If the battery gets low, the machine goes back to the base, charges up, and then goes right back to where it stopped and finishes the job.  The app is easy to use and so far has worked very well.  Our floors are clean and it is one less thing we have to worry about when we come home from work and it's one less chore on the weekend.

Our dogs hated the old vacuum and would chase it around, flip it down stairways, etc. It was time to replace it.  I purchased a new Eufy self emptying model and hated it after one use.  It got stuck in sooooo many places! Plus it had these tiny little bags that it emptied into that would require me to spend a fortune on replacement bags. I returned it and began researching Shark robot vacuums.  I ordered this and was in awe of how well it worked! It mapped out our home and let me set up ""no go"" areas. I have this run every morning and it covers a large area, returns to the base to recharge and then resumes cleaning. It does a really nice job and has cut down on the time needed to run a manual vacuum.  With two dogs and a busy household it gets a workout every day! It would not hold 60 days of debris for our household due to the dog hair. But that is not a big deal. I typically empty the canister every two to three weeks even though it isn't full.  It goes over area rugs like a champ! There are three floor vents that it will occasionally get stuck on if it hits them at the right angle...but that only happens about every other week.... and only on one of the three.  Getting stuck once out of 14 runs isn't too bad. Especially when our old Eufy would get stuck multiple times in one run.The cons have been that recently I will get an error saying the bin is not installed correctly...but it is and the vacuum continues to run and works just fine.  It's annoying that the app sends the notification while it is in fact working fine.  The other complaint is about the app as well. If the vacuum does get stuck the app will not show where it is. You must activate the beeper on it to locate the vacuum. Not a big deal, unless of course the battery has died and it is unable to beep.  Fortunately, we are aware of the three possible spots that it gets hung up and can check those if we are unable to locate it by sound.  I do think the battery could last longer.  It runs for about 45 minutes on normal power before it needs to return to recharge.Besides its cleaning ability the next best thing...our dogs completely ignore this vacuum! I don't know if the older one made a sound that only they could hear and find annoying or what. But they have paid zero attention to this since its first run!Read more"

It's app enrages me more every single day and I'm about to simply put it in the attic because without the app it becomes increasingly useless; I wish I could take away more stars this app is so bad. I'm hoping SharkNinja cares enough to read these reviews and actually takes action, otherwise they may go the way of Sonos with their horrible app decisions. This isn't 2005 when iRobot could do stupid things and get away with it because there was no competition. While I'm not one to throw money away, I will replace this with something else that actually works and doesn't need an app to do simple scheduled cleaning runs. I could give two hoots about whether it has a ""map"" at this point, just clean the doggone floor -- do the basic thing you claim to be able to do and do it well. Is that so hard?I'm guessing they don't care given they can't seem to do simple things like when I log into their website with exactly the same credentials I use in the app, it doesn't show my registered products, or when I scan the QR code in the app to store the Model and S/N it can't store it for more than about 5 minutes before it literally just disappears. If you can't do simple things, complex ones are probably out of reach.The system has some kind of serious software bug in it related to map storage. I work for a software company, and all the signs are present that there is a significant problem with the storage system for maps and/or the communication between the app and the robot relating to the map. I say this because our robot just lost its map one day about a month ago. No errors, no problems running, it just literally disappeared. The schedule continued to run, so I didn't notice it until I looked at the cleaning notification one day and noticed that it was reporting a run time of almost 2 hours (which sounded about right) but a 0 ft squared cleaned. It sure made a lot of noise and picked up a lot of dirt for not cleaning any square footage of my first floor! When I dug into the app, the map was gone. Just not there. When going into settings to look at the map, I just get the infuriating purple spinner. No messages, no indicators of a problem, just a total lack of communication about what is going on and no map.So I set about the task of trying to correct the problem. First, I delete the map and go to try and re-explore. It seems to delete, and it will run an exploration run, but then it just sits with that obnoxious purple spinner and the question about whether the map represents the home properly or should it re-explore, with the Accept button greyed out and NO OTHER OPTIONS AVAILABLE. I've re-explored 20 times and left it sitting on that screen overnight for 8 hours with it never finishing. Ever. And this is why it's about to become trash!!! Without running the explore successfully, you can't set the schedule! You can't run a manual cleaning run with the app! If I wanted a vacuum I had to physically go push the button on, I could have bought something a heck of a lot less expensive (which is what I'm likely to do at this point).SO then I thought, like most technology of this sort, it might just need a complete fresh start. Stuff happens, memory gets corrupted and needs wiped, no problem. So I deleted the robot from the app and had to go through the mind-numbing and excruciating process of re-joining to my post 1995 WiFi network which is too fancy and elaborate with its new-fangled 5GHz technology for these developers to figure out (or Shark is too cheap and obsessed with profits to use a more modern WiFi SoC). Go through that process and run the explore another 10 times with no change.Then I reset to supposedly factory settings. Same result. Same absolute rage-inducing nonsense getting it to connect to the WiFi (though I think I finally figured out the trick on that). I am not convinced it actually DOES reset to factory settings or wipes the memory clean, because I'm continuing to have the same problem. Exploration simply will not finish successfully and so I can't schedule or make it clean without having to go under the table and push the button. Total ridiculousness. A factory reset should restore a copy of the firmware as it was when it came out of the factory -- and mapping worked out of the box. Now it doesn't. I am left with the conclusion the reset does NOT actually reset the memory.This is just infuriating. Oh, and before you say ""contact support"". I have. Crickets and bullfrogs, ladies and gentlemen. So far, crickets and bullfrogs. If that changes, I'll post a new update, though.Message to SharkNinja -- when you released an app, you became a software company. That has certain requirements and sets certain expectations. You are FAILING to meet any of them.+++ HOW TO DEAL WITH MODERN WIFI AND THIS RIDICULOUS TWELVE CENT WIFI CHIP +++The key to making this work is whether your phone is trying to access the Internet or any from anything other than the same 2.4GHz connection this unit is using. So what I have to do:1. Log into Eero and turn of 5GHz (on my version this is under troubleshooting; nearly every mesh single-SSID system has a mechanism to temporarily disable 5GHz b/c this cheapness is so prevalent in so many devices)2. Turn WiFi off on phone and leave off for a couple of minutes (this is a precaution to make sure 5GHz is truly not picking up the connection)3. Turn mobile data off on my phone (airplane mode didn't cut it 2 out of 3 times; turning off mobile data always worked)4. Turn WiFi back on and make sure Bluetooth is on; if you tried airplane mode and left bluetooth off and don't turn it back on again until the app prompts you, you're hosed and will have to start over from the beginning - I experienced this multiple times5. Put robot into discovery mode6. Connect to the robot and go through the unnecessarily plentiful prompts full of stupid and useless information in the ""wizard""7. When you get to the network selection screen, your WiFi network SSID should show up --- if it doesn't, one more thing to do is go into your phone WiFi settings and join your 2.4GHz network (keeping the Shark app in the background), which will disconnect you from the WiFi Direct connection with the robot; let it connect fully; then go disconnect from your access point and reconnect to the robot WiFi Direct AP in your phone settings. 1 out of 3 times I had to initiate that re-connection, which I'm guessing is due to some sort of timeout happening, but I'm not sure.***** PREVIOUS REVIEW *****I got a previous version of this vacuum robot for my wife's business space and was super impressed with it. It didn't really NEED me to use WiFi and the app to make it work, and wow, she knew the floors were dirty, but not THAT dirty. It's done really well for her in the couple of months she's had it.Come Prime Day 2024, I figured I'd pick something up for the house. Our Jack Russell terrier is getting older and shedding like a monster, and I abhor dog hair, so having something that could help us keep up with that was desirable. Having been an early adopter of the Roomba back in the day, the one thing I abhorred and has kept me from a robot vacuum since going through 2 or 3 early versions was emptying the anemic dust bins on these things. The self emptying on my wife's has been awesome and I was looking at this to be even better because AI, right?Well, yeah, not so much.As a physical vacuum, the unit cleans pretty well. I don't have any real complaints there, and the self-emptying is nice and has worked well so far. LOTS of dog hair in that bin. More than I realized was present, actually. Gross. But it is hands-free to empty which is pretty awesome. So it does clean (perhaps) even better than I expected.This unit leaves me utterly disappointed in the app and it's supposed AI, however. The intelligence is pretty artificial from what I can tell, and not in a good way.Getting the system to map the house took three tries before it decided it actually did need to go into the big 20 square foot, devoid of any furniture, people or other obstructions area in my mud room. It did finally map the full space, and shows the area to be roughly 900 feet. By my calculations that's roughly right, and the map is pretty close in its shape, though there is a big blob in one of the rooms I still don't quite think aligns to reality. But it's close enough, and the vacuum will still go into the area represented by the blob, so I'm not really sure what that's about. I guess I could be misinterpreting the display, after all I don't have Artificial Intelligence, I just have my brain.Where the app falls utterly short, though is there is no true practical use of the intelligence the system has built about the area. It has a map, but can't really use it in a meaningful way! The value of a robot vacuum isn't to make a bunch of racket while running around a specific room while I'm entertaining or trying to watch a movie. The value proposition of a vacuum robot is to automate tasks I don't want to do on my own. Like scheduling a cleaning job in a specific room at one time, and scheduling another cleaning job in another room during another time window. Being able to send the robot to a specific room ad hoc isn't in the top 5 basic requirements I would post for a system like this. Top 10, maybe? But not before actual honest-to-goodness helpful AUTOMATION.But Shark has not deemed the utilization of the map with the schedule to be an important feature for their app. It's an FAQ as to whether you CAN do that, so it isn't like they don't KNOW people want this capability. And multi-point scheduling is something that vacuum robots have been able to do for years (iRobot's app can do this for most models now, for instance, as can other brands). Multi-point scheduling is such a simple app task at this point there are libraries available for plugging that kind of function into a mobile app. Come on, Shark, you aren't in the least bit intelligent if you can't actually use the intelligence to do something useful!!! THIS IS SHAMEFUL and speaks to a complete lack of either 1) understanding your customer use cases or 2) caring enough about your customer to do something besides put your shortcomings into an FAQ.SO you can't schedule the vacuum to work on specific rooms it has mapped out at specific times, scheduled cleaning is an all or nothing thing. BUT, if you enable a no-go zone to try and, say, keep the dogs from being too overly disturbed during the all or nothing scheduled cleaning, that area is now apparently a black hole singularity for the vacuum and can never be gone into again as long as the circuits of the poor little creature draw power. Unless you of course go to the pain of deleting the no-go zone to get it spot cleaned, and then have to work with the app to maybe successfully recreate it.The creation of rooms and no-go zones has been a spotty and painful action within the app. Sometimes it works, sometimes it hasn't. I've had to go so far as to reboot my phone to get the ""resizer"" of a no-go zone to resize or move around on the map and the app acknowledge and save it properly. I'm done recreating the zones and will just sweep those from now on, I'm so fed up with it. The fact that you can't override these zones for a spot clean, is again a sign of either complete development laziness or incompetence. It's a simple matter of a question -- ""you've asked to spot clean this area, would you like to override the no-go zone for this session"" and then let the little guy run wild in his heretofore restricted space. It's AI, after all, not just common human intelligence we're working with here!!The reason that the all or nothing approach to scheduled jobs sucks so bad is that this thing is LOUD. My wife's unit is not loud like this one (I'm guessing the 'superior' AI brain of this model must be making the loud clacking sound on our home model, but I'm not sure). From the first run taking it out of the box, it has made a terribly loud clacking sound as it runs around picking up dirt. I've looked at all the troubleshooting steps and the brush isn't clogged, there's nothing stuck in it, and it is firmly in place like it should be, but it definitely seems as if the bristles or the little blue sweeper stripes are hitting the cross bar of the guard hard enough to make an obnoxious sound. I know it's brush bar related, because when the super brain was running around the house for three hours mapping things, it was actually relatively quiet -- enough so that if that's how it was when doing its job, I'd have no other problems; alas that's not the case.SO, when you're trying to get that scheduled all or nothing cleaning done overnight, and the kids are downstairs in the basement trying to sleep, all they hear is a thwack-thwack-thwack-thwack-thwack sound as it runs around the first floor. And since it seems ~900 square feet of space is too much for the system to do on a full charge, it starts doing that thwack-thwack-thwack thing at 3am after it has returned to the dock and recharged.I do really like the ""return to recharge"" and ""return to empty"" features, don't get me wrong they're awesome, but with all the racket and the all or nothing approach, I can't get the whole first floor vacuumed and the kids a full night's sleep. It's rather sad (first world problem, I know, I know, I should put brooms in the kids hands -- we do that too!) but for what you pay for this device (even on Prime Day) that claims to have an AI engine at play in its favor, I expect more.And just to be clear, this isn't a house that's filthy with layers of dirt all over the floor by the time the little dude gets going. We swiffer and sweep throughout the day to clean up spot messes and we're not living on a farm or something where we're tracking in mud three inches deep a day. There's kid chaff and some dog chaff around, but this isn't a ""heavy"" mess we're dealing with on a daily basis.While I don't love the unit, it does appear to me that proper app development and updates would resolve the problems I have (outside of the noise). I could work around the noise with more powerful intelligence brought to the scheduling, though, so I'm hopeful they'll put the work in and resolve the shortcomings. If that happens, stars could easily be added to the review.Read more"

First thing right out the box, minor scratches but overall clean and lovely. Set up was easy, router stuff from the app was a little annoying at first.I was very afraid because others mentioned it was not good but after naming the vacuum Robo and letting him fully charge out the box, he was running off and scooping up everything.You will definitely have to mop and sweep tight corners but as daily maintenance, it helps so much when it’s the house’s least favorite chore. Works especially good on tile.It also does not feel cheap, and yes it bumps into everything and makes a lot of noise, but you eventually grow fond of it.After about two weeks of cleaning I had two bins full of dust, pet hair, dirt, and hair. It’s a house of three ladies, and one little feline lady. The man treks through the house with his shoes on (ugh.)The charging isn’t bad, Robo throws a little fit when he’s around 30% to go back to his dock. This was my biggest fear, but the charging is straightforward. Mine has not been able to be very consistent with finding his dock, but that’s totally ok. I just pick him up and let him rest and then bother him later.As for value of money, I had a huge credit from Amazon so I got him for 32 bucks. That is a crazy steal, and honestly, I would probably pay 79 bucks for this little guy again.Fabulous little starter, but if you’re already spoilt by bigger brands, go for the bigger brands haha.Read more"

In my opinion, this is the BEST budget vacuum at the price point.  I purchased one on sale for $139.  It was super easy to get started and watch it go with AMAZING results in the dustbin!  Okay, so it was purchased to use at my parents' house, but I HAD to test it, right? :)  Now, it worked so well, I immediately ordered 2 more (taking advantage of the $ale) and have 2 at my parents' house and one at my own.  I use the schedule feature in the app to run mine every day at 9am.  It starts up perfectly.  With a Basset hound, it does an amazing job of keeping the house livable in between my own vacuum/mop jobs.  I'm a firm believer in doing a deep clean with a larger vacuum, but with this running in between, my house is HUGELY improved.  To top it off, running it at my parents' house couldn't be easier with the app.  I can start and stop them on MY app, and all they have to do is empty the dust bins.  I've been running them for a little over a month now, and am very happy with the results.PROS:  -Runs much longer than predicted, even on standard power.  -Easy to empty dustbin.  -It has an Air filter (and despite others saying you have to remove screws to get to it, you don't. The outer mesh is fixed in place with a screw, but the filter cartridge slips out the side).  -You can ""Set it and forget it"" for the most part if you use scheduling.  -Compared to a standard vacuum, this baby is VERY quiet.  That isn't to say it doesn't make any noise (seriously, it has suction and airflow... it's GONNA make noise).  -If you put it in ECO mode, it is even quieter, but regardless of the mode, my basset doesn't run from it. :)CONS:  All 3 of the models have a 'different' sound when running.  Seriously, they each sound completely different and have different noise levels, which makes me wonder.  Next, she -her name is Suzie- completely ignores the boundary strips I purchased to use.  (And no, I did NOT place it under anything.  I even tested by laying it face up straight across the edge of the carpet... on top.  NOPE, she rolls right over it -_- ... and the 2nd one I cut to fit the base of a pole lamp that she kept getting stuck half on/off of.  Since it was metal, the strip just magnetically attached to the round base side... NOPE, she still bangs into it.  Although she hasn't hopped up onto it anymore so... you be the judge)TIPS:  1st-If you get it on sale, go ahead and add the warranty coverage.  I did.  In my opinion, a CYA is always a good thing.  It gives me piece of mind that if one of them turns out to be a lemon (all things have them, even vehicles) I'm covered.  The most I'd have to pay is shipping and that is NOTHING compared to purchasing a new one.  Besides, as I said above, they each have a unique motor sound, and I feel better knowing that if there is anything that would take away from the motor life involved, I'll get a repair or a replacement.  2nd-take the time to look at the undercarriage and inspect the roller.  You never know what could potentially get wound onto that brush roll, and it's super easy to pop it out and clean it off (if you've ever had a large vacuum, you should already know to do this as regular maintenance).  Keep in mind that the harder that brush roll has to work, the more pull it puts on the Motor.  Stressing that little thing will potentially take away from its life of service.Final Thoughts?  I love it and would recommend it to anybody and everybody.  And if it's on sale it is HUGE bang for your buck$!** I gave all 5 stars except the 4 on Deep Cleaning ONLY because of my own beliefs that you need to get out the big vacuum at least once a month (depending on your environment maybe a little more often).Read more"

It does a good job picking up dust, pet hair, and small debris, and after mopping the floors look noticeably fresher. The self-emptying base is very convenient-you can forget about the dustbin for a long time. I also appreciate that it maps the apartment and cleans according to the map, which really saves time and makes daily cleaning much easier.There are some things that could be improved. The robot is quite rough: it often bumps into walls or furniture, and sometimes instead of avoiding objects on the floor, it tries to climb over them. The battery doesn’t last as long as I would like, especially during intensive cleaning. Occasionally, it fails to detect its docking station and even bumps into it. Also, it has only one side brush -having two would make the cleaning more balanced and efficient.Read more"

I own three Great Pyrenees dogs that live a lot of the time inside the home. At least three characteristics are true about Great Pyrenees: They bark, they are lovers and they ARE HAIRY! Each morning I quickly get the big hair globs with a stick vac; then I turn my Lefant Robot loose! I can control and monitor it with my smartphone. We call him “New Puppy!” Sometimes he’ll work for 90 minutes or even two hours, then dock himself for a recharge. That’s when I dump out the hair and remove hair from the filter. The final step is rolling a lint roller over the filter to grab any resistive hair. Then I  reinsert the cartridge in New Puppy.

I love Fred!  He has a decent battery, is adorable when he gets stuck in places he shouldn't go and knows how to get back to the dock to have a nap.Scheduling with the app was easy, set up as a whole was a breeze. Fred wakes up Monday-Friday at 7am and does the cleaning while I work in my office. (living that work from home life)  Saturday and Sunday I manually turn him on and have him start his work depending on what we have going on for those days.  The amount of cat fur it sucks up is crazy, I'm not even sure where Fred is finding all of it.  My very skittish rescue long hair cat is terrified of everything, but likes to watch Fred.  It is a bit loud but not as loud as a standard vacuum cleaner.Emptying the container is super simple as well.  Plus there are multiple settings you can program.I love Fred and I'm thinking about getting Fred a girlfriend to keep in the addition of my house.  He hasn't fallen down the stairs yet so that's a plus.Very happy with this purchase, I was a bit apprehensive of buying a brand I didn't know but since it was on sale for Prime days I was like meh, might as well. If it's garbage I'll just return.Not garbage, have had Fred for a while now and he has made keeping my hardwood floors clean so much easier.I still run my cordless vacuum once or twice a week but that's because I have sensory issues and I can't stand anything being on the floor and getting on my feet. I also have 3 cats and a messy husband.Read more"

All of the videos must be saved on the cloud.2: The control goes through the cloud servers and is so laggy, that it might take 20 seconds for your input to actually start moving the camera. If your connection is lost when moving the camera, it will keep moving that direction until it hits its limit.3: The camera has 360 degrees of rotation, but it has a stop at the end of the circle. So it can move 360 degrees one way, but to go back around, you have to spin it 360 degrees the other way.4: My camera didnt work at all when I got it and I had to go through their support to get new firmware. I had to manually load the firmware since it was so old, it wasn't compatible with their current system. What a mess!5: The camera moves on its own.

This camera DOES NOT have infrared assisted night vision.  It does have a night viewing mode which is not that great.  You would think, since it is an actual light source, that viewing in the dark wouldn’t be a problem.  Setting up the camera took some time too, but if you are familiar with any Zmodo camera setup, it should be fairly simple. The 360 rotation is great! You will be able to rotate both directions and see 360 view, but each direction has a stopping point.  I added pictures demonstrating the wide angle view.  When you open the camera view just tap twice on your phone and it will switch from wide angle to regular view.  The color options on this camera are AWESOME! Can’t wait for the holidays to switch between all the color options! I place these cameras outside and since they are a bit bulky, I did have to remove the glass covering from the light fixture in order to get 1 of them to fit.

Documentation is limited and leaves a lot to be desired. It only works if you know to click on a small check buried among alphabetic characters on only some screens. The installation instructions are clear, simple and well done. However, one critical piece of information is missing. It's not mentioned ANYWHERE!! You must highlight and click on a check mark when entering zone names or the WiFi password. This check mark only appears on some of the screen options when entering alphanumeric characters for naming zones or passwords. Additionally, the highlight is difficult to see unless you're at or below the plane of the screen. The characters are small but visible. Once I figured out that the check indicates the name or password is complete, everything worked flawlessly. Connecting it to my cell phone was a breeze. The phone graphics are beautiful and you can control everything easily and intuitively.  Only time will tell how effective it is at saving water by accurately predicting rainfall at my house, not the weather station.A weather resistant cabinet is required for outside mounting. The cabinet is manufactured by Orbit. The model number is 57095. It has an internal GFI receptacle so mounting the Skydrop inside is very simple. You will have to drill mounting holes in the internal mounting plate, but that's a simple job that can easily be done by the installers or anyone who can use a drill.Cudo's to the designers and shame on the documentation people for making a simple installation unnecessarily frustrating.Read more"
Smart Garden,Skydrop Halo Smart Sprinkler System Controller | Alexa and Google Home Enabled | WiFi Connected | 8-Zone Irrigation System on Your Water Bill,149.,3.2,576,https://us.amazon.com/dp/B00LLZ496O,1.0,"September 14, 2016",1.0 out of 5 starsWhat's to like? A month of frustration.,"What's to like? A month of frustration.I bought the SkyDrop system as well as the expansion module but returned them within the first 30 days as the system never worked correctly.1) Control and User Interface: Let's start with the controller. What's the point of the fancy space-age design with the cool display screen and sexy glowing control dial? This controller is essentially an industrial device that will be installed in some utility room or closet and never looked at after installation since you will be using the app or a computer to control it. This does not negatively affect the device's operation. It's just weird.The app was easy to use and intuitive but the app would frequently lose contact with the device and then nothing would work. The app would often say that it lost the WiFi connection with the device, even though the device screen reflected that it was connected via WiFi with good signal strength. Often I could get the controller to work only via my laptop computer via WiFi, but not the app connected through the same WiFi.2) Installation: The installation was very easy as advertised, but the device could never recognize one of my connected irrigation zones. The zone worked perfectly and could be activated manually through the device but the device would not recognize it to control it automatically. The expansion module (to increase zone capacity to 16 zones) also was easy to install.3) Customer Service: I called customer service and was told to perform a factory reset on the controller, but this action essentially killed the controller. Customer service agreed to send me a replacement for the defective controller, but refused to sent the replacement via overnight shipment as that was ""against company policy"" according to the customer service supervisor.4) Replacement controller: I received a replacement controller, but the controller was apparently an older reconditioned SkyDrop model instead of the newer version SkyDrop Plus module that I was trying to replace (It says ""SkyDrop Plus"" on the face of the controller). The replacement controller would not allow the expansion module to work at all but as I was going on vacation soon and needed something to water my plants, I used it with just the eight zones.5) Timer programming: I programmed the device to water my plants each morning (easy to program) using manual programming rather than allow the device to automatically water based on the weather, etc. Each morning the system would send me an e-mail letting me know that the system had watered my zones as programmed. The app also reflected that the zones were watered every day at the programmed time. The problem is that the device never actually watered anything at all! It would tell me that it did so, but never did anything. It did allow me to manually request watering of each zone for whatever amount of time I wanted. It just would not allow this to happen with the timer. Each day, I would request through the app manual watering one zone at a time and this would work fine.6) In complete frustration, I returned the system for a full refund within the 30 day return period.7) Recommendation: Buy anything except the SkyDrop and you'll be happy. I bought the Rachio system and am completely happy with it. It works correctly all the time! It's made in the USA and was easy to install. The app is simple to use. It waters my plants perfectly every day and never fails. The Rain Machine also gets great reviews but I have not tried that system.Read more"
Smart Garden,Skydrop Halo Smart Sprinkler System Controller | Alexa and Google Home Enabled | WiFi Connected | 8-Zone Irrigation System on Your Water Bill,149.,3.2,576,https://us.amazon.com/dp/B00LLZ496O,4.0,"March 4, 2016",4.0 out of 5 starsA great device with a few caveats during installation...,"So I purchased and installed two of these at two separate locations and couldn't be happier.  It is relatively easy to install just take the zone wires from your existing controller and the common and/or master valve wire and connect it to the backplate of the SkyDrop controller.  The wires leading to both units I installed required me to splice the existing wires to something with a higher gauge wire as the thickness of the insulation coming from the sprinkler valves were too thick to slip into the small opening on the SkyDrop's back plate.  It would have been nice to have a wider opening but hopefully that will come in v2...  When you wire the back plate and plug in the power supply there is a hot connection that can be used to test each of your zones.  When a zone wire is connected to this hot connection the zone comes one.  The first time I did this the zone wouldn't turn off after removing the zone wire so I had to find the shutoff valve and turn it off manually.  After that was done I finished wiring the common, master valve, and the respective zone's and followed the on-screen instructions to get the unit connected to the internet via wi-fi.  The mobile app works well but for creating complex schedules I would suggest using the web site at skydrop.com.  The second attempt at installation of another unit yielded another strange scenario.  After wiring all of the zones and going through the setup I discovered that the setup would hang during the wi-fi connection prompt.  It wasn't obvious until I read through the support site that the SkyDrop has trouble with WiFi Names (SSID's) with certain non alphanumeric characters.  It basically caused my setup to choke...  I renamed my wifi connection to get rid of the non-alphanumeric characters and was able to continue the setup without issue.  Upon connecting the SkyDrop to the internet an update was immediately installed...  I later changed my WiFi SSID name to what it was before and was able to join without any problems...  It appears they have fixed that issue but there may be some units still on the shelf with the old firmware so beware if your SSID has non-alphanumeric characters in it.  I've only had this for a week but can say it is easy to use and works very well.  You can easily make changes via the mobile app while away from your house and check to see how things are working.  The large lighted dial gives quick indication as to what is going on while watering as the typically green dial turns blue when watering as well as shows a status of all the zones and how much time is left.  Looking forward to seeing the water timing change as the temperatures rises and lowers and also stop watering when it is raining outside based on local weather forecasts...  The SkyDrop also integrates with the Nest Protect smoke detectors if you have one.  If it detects fire it will turn on your sprinkler system...  That's a feature I hope I won't get the chance to test....SkyDrop 8 Zone (Expandable to 16) Wifi-Enabled Smart Sprinkler ControllerRead more"

No sooner did I get connected and install my irrigation system, I received an email from Skydrop stating they would start charging a monthly/annual subscription. They touted themselves as being affordable and never having a subscription but they have back-peddled on that statement based on “weather underground” being purchased and them having to have a more affordable data feed. This is quite unfortunate. If the interface wasn’t so buggy (such as often defaulting to my previous unit in another city), I’d be more inclined to pay their subscription fee but the fact remains, giving a weeks notice that the most useful features this system has, will be restricted unless you pay for it, like manual watering for crying out loud, is ridiculous. I am debating returning this product at this point on principle.Read more"

Smart Garden,"Discontinued Rachio WiFi Smart Lawn Sprinkler Controller, 8-Zone 2nd Generation, Alexa Compatible with Rain, Freeze and Wind Skip (8ZULW-B)",199.,4.6,"2,604",https://us.amazon.com/dp/B01D1NMLJU,5.0,"May 1, 2016",5.0 out of 5 starsThe other reviews are right. This thing rocks!,"Welcome to modern sprinkler control! It makes the other big brand units on the market look like childs toys. I've used the software from one brand which was terrible- buggy and it never worked as it should, it also looked like it was designed in the early 1990's. In addition of course, the regular controller systems that take forever to program, you have to keep an eye on the seasons and change it regularly to ensure you're not over or under watering, etc... This really puts them all to shame.Unboxing- It's a little odd to me based on the number of sprinkler system controllers I've installed over the years that there isn't any control panel on the front. It kind of reminds me of a router or something similar, which is what they were going for. A bit stylish for the garage, but simple is good, and it probably saves them quite a chunk of cash to not have all that stuff on board. Besides, why would you use a clunky panel when you can just run it off the smartphone or computer!Physical installation- Super easy. Just like any other sprinkler controller on the market. A couple of screws, wire it up, good to go. The push in terminals for the wiring is a nice touch, again keeping it simple.Wireless setup- Had to run the setup a couple of times to get it registered all the way on my wifi network. It was pretty darned intuitive though, so it didn't take more than about 10 minutes to get it hooked up and done.Software setup- This took a little more time, as I wasn't familiar with some of the terms or the specific soil types. After a little research on the county soil maps, I was able to find what I needed to select the soil type correctly. This is an important step, as different soil types will drain at different rates. It would probably impact the way the unit waters as well. I selected a pretty close weather station to get the most local information possible, and tested all the zones. Sure enough, worked like a champ.Rain delays- A+ on this one. The day I was installing this unit we were getting a pretty good amount of rain. I set the unit to the default water saving schedule and it immediately pushed out the first watering day from Saturday to Monday based on the amount of rainfall the local weather station got. Neat! I'm not 100% sure how accurate the water usage estimates are, but in the first couple of weeks it estimates I've save almost 1000 gallons.Web/phone interface- Nicely done. Both the app and web app are really simple to use, and obviously major thought has gone into the user experience. You can drill deeper into it if you want to, or just keep it fairly simple. I use the android app to check in on it, as well as the web app from my computer.TL;DR: Great unit. Well thought out and performs as it should.Read more"

It does seem that you get what you pay for. The installation was easy. I had absolutely not problems connecting the app to the controller and then to my home network. The signal strength to my router was average.I would say that the functionality of the controller is so-so, you can setup and run zones from the controller but all the good stuff in in the app and it makes setup and configuration very easy. I've had other hardware that depended on an app to configure it and been disappointed with the app (I'm looking at you Linksys) but the Rachio app is outstanding. You can set schedules, start/stop zones, and even check the current weather. If you use the automatic scheduling feature you can look several months into the future to get an idea of when and how often watering will occur. It's smart enough to know that here in Florida I don't need to water as often in Winter but forecasts that I will during Summer.The app allows you to configure each zone based on vegetation, soil type, amount of sun it receives, the type of sprinkler heads used, and the slope. There are advanced parameters to allow you to set much more in-depth configurations.The app provides information about the last time it watered a zone and the next time it is planned to be watered.It also provides information about how much water, in gallons, that have been used and saved but without a flow meter or being very precise in the advanced configurations I don't see how this can be very accurate, but it is a nice touch and does provide at least some knowledge of your water use. You could probably read your water meter before and after to get an idea of how accurate it is and then make some tweaks to the app to get it closer.I think the thing I like most is that when I'm working on sprinkler heads I can start/stop the zone I'm working on standing next to the head that I testing. No more starting a zone and then having to run thru the sprinklers to get to the head I'm working on. Very convenient.I cannot speak (yet) to it's ability to monitor rainfall in the area and shift watering schedules but I will know better once warmer weather returns and I'll re-post to my review.Anyway, I feel comfortable recommending it and I don't think you'll be disappointed.Read more"

I use various styles of emitters (drip, spray, low volume spinners, etc.).  Over time things disconnect, clog and break.  These must be discovered and repaired.  All of the emitters in all of the zones are remote from the Rachio controller.  There's at least 600' of half inch poly serving the zones. The beauty of this situation is that I can be in the field turning zones on and off for testing from my cell phone and making repairs as needed without slogging up and down, in and out to operate zones from the controller.Extremely easy install and a short learning curve for basic operation.

I have read numerous reviews on this product and decided to purchase through Amazon.ca since there was no retailer available here in Canada.  The product was delivered in a timely manner and the price was comparable to other irrigation controllers.  Upon receiving the product I was surprise and pleased with the small size of the controller.  I ordered the 8 zone model but the size is no different from the 16 zone model.  The manuals provided or the ones available for download were fairly helpful. Some of the language and terminology could be changed but basically they were helpful. This model, Rachio Gen 2, has replace a Rainbird Esp-ME (working) and is used for my 4 zone irrigation ( front yard, side yard, back yard and flower gardens). We don't experience the water restrictions that others in warmer clients do however we do have some restrictions occasionally.  We are on city water and we pay a flat rate for the water service each year.  Water savings is not critical however it is always a concern. It also rains here...a lot.Since I am a building contractor, installing the Rachio controller in my home was not a problem.  The controller looks as though it is hardwired however it is not.  A nice clean look is very important to me. I was able to modify the wall which accepts the controller.  Installation of the controller was pretty straightforward. Here are a few of the pros and cons:Pros:  The ability to control most aspects of the irrigation through my phone or computer is  certainly beneficial. The Rachio Gen 2 controller uses local weather or PWS's for irrigation times. There are a couple of sensor options on the controller as well. (rain, flow)  I can also manually water each zone, anytime, anywhere, if I want, thru my phone.  I can also change schedules through my phone or computer. This is a very convenient feature for myself and potentially for my clients.  I haven't had to use the one 800 number yet and the updates are relatively frequent. The engineers at Rachio seem to be making slight changes to the product with some improvements. So far...so good. (That's encouragement btw)Cons: since the Rachio product is reliant on local weather stations to preform at its best,  availability of good local or personal weather stations in my area is critical.  The Rachio app allows you to choose local weather stations however these are limited to a few. My closes pws is 4.5 km away and the reliability is questionable. Having the WU (weather underground) as an option could be benificial to me and to Rachio.  Personal weather stations in my area afiliated with the weather underground appear to be more reliant. Rachio does provide a work-a-round to the WU, but you must have a Mac ($1000-$2000). There are other option too but the price just goes up. ( special router, your own PWS $$$).Power. An option to hardwire the product. I don't want to see the wires.Start/Stop. I see the option to start irrigation at a specific time within the app but...I don't see the option to stop irrigation at a specific time. I need to stop at 9am. C'mon!Generally the Rachio Gen 2 product is fairly good. The updates and improvements seem slow in coming but I hold out hope that they will eventually arrive. I'll use the Rachio and watch the updates but I will keep the Rainbird ESP-ME on hand just in case.Update; April 2017, I've been using the Gen2 Rachio for almost a year now. No glitches at all. Updates are regular and the controller preformed as advertised. Other irrigation controllers are late to the table (smart features) or too bulky. I would give this controller 4 1/2 to 5 stars (ability to hardwire and weather station).So far...very good.Read more"

It skips watering when it rains, and it is trivially easy to turn on sprinklers for an additional manual watering if desired.

My son works in sales from home and required a faster and more stable connection than he had in his office at the far end from my modem. We decided to install a mesh WIFI system and chose TP-link's Deco S4 (3-pack). Once up and running (easy) we weren't able to achieve a faster speed than the range extenders. Although, things were slightly better in coverage and stability.  After reading a lot about do's and don'ts of mesh WIFI systems we decided to return the Deco S4 and get the Deco AX3000 X55 (3-pack) system. Here are the early results:1. My son's speed more than doubled to 535 Mbps, which is almost the same speed I get being directly connected to the modem at the other end of the house. In other words the rated speed that our ISP sold us.2. The TVs haven't buffered even though we use streaming exclusively on 3 sets. Plus we have mobile phones and other assorted gadgets that use the internet.3. My wife's PC, even farther than my son's, is getting almost double the speed (145 Mbps) that it got with the S4 and triple the speed she received from the range extenders.4. Very easy setup via the mobile app.Here are some of the reasons why the newest mesh system is better from a technical perspective:1. The AX3000 is rated at double the speed of the S4 (at less than double the cost on Amazon using their coupon).2. The AX3000 has a maximum of 6500 sq. feet of coverage vs. 5500 sq. feet for the S4.3. The AX3000 is WIFI 6 vs. WIFI 5 on the S4. This means a 50% increase in ""streams"" providing greater functionality and speed because there are more paths to the base station router. One of the x55s (base station) sits next to our ISP's modem and the other two are set up as satellites at the other ends of the house. Satellites can be connect via ethernet cable (called a backhaul) if you have cable already installed in some rooms.  This should increase the throughput.  Unfortunately, we weren't able to do this.4. The AX3000 is smaller than the S4 and thus doesn't stand out as much. This is not a technical issue, however we plan to mount two of the units on the wall with wall mounts that can be purchased separately.  The S4 is almost twice as tall so may tip out of the mounts easier.  Plus the cord and charger is white rather than black so doesn't stand out as much.5. Other systems are faster and cover more area, but are significantly more expensive for a 3-pack.  Also most use WIFI 6E, which we don't need because we're in a single family home. I understand WIFI 6E comes with those systems because it's good for people in large apartment buildings. It's not faster but does have a third band in the 6 Ghz range which WIFI 6 does not.Update: I have had trouble connecting our solar panel gateway to the new system. Our solar system installer suggested connecting to the 2.4 Ghz band because or WIFI is now mesh.  I didn't know we had that capability until I read an earlier post by another happy user.  I will now research how to do this.Read more"

I was expecting to have to run network cables and utilize long-range point-to-point transceiver antennas to get WiFi to the farther outbuildings, but the Deco routers were pushing strong enough signal and automatically connected to each other in a such a way that cable runs and extra antennas weren't necessary.The routers were extremely easy to configure using the Deco app, and deploying them across the property was a breeze. The range on the units is impressive, easily covering 70+ feet and going through dense log-cabin walls. I was extremely impressed when one particular router which was too far away to communicate with the main unit had its traffic automatically routed through the next closest unit in a nearby building, daisy-chaining itself so that it could be connected and without any additional setup or configuration on my part. Speeds at all units were well within acceptable ranges, with all except one Deco getting over 100mbps download speeds. The mesh capabilities of the devices are very efficient and effective, with my mobile device automatically switching to the router with the best signal strength as I moved around the property.The Deco app made setup and management of the network very easy, with details like a network map, device heartbeat info, parental controls, and more. Adding all 6 routers to the network was easy and fast.This system ended up saving me time and materials, and saving my customer money because of how easy and effective it was at providing WiFi coverage around his property without the need for extra hardware or equipment.Read more"

After a few firmware updates and once TP-Link fixed the AP only mode such that the main and guest networks are truly separated I switched over from using it as a router to an AP solution. It has worked flawlessly since and without any performance degradation's.I still do not like the app-centric approach for ""management"" (cannot call it that honestly); insight would probably be more appropriate. But, I will be moving in the future to an enterprise grade solution (this solution purchase has just been a stop-gap until that time and I finalize my network architecture). For the average home consumer that is not very tech-savvy (which is the audience this product really targets) it is overall very simple to get up and running with very few issues, especially at this price point.I have submitted over a dozen feature requests to TP-Link and almost all of them have been discarded by the manufacturer (but at least acknowledged); of the ones that were ""accepted"" they were very trivial.As of today, Sep 21 20201, the system via the app is no longer able to check for updates (it receives an error). I believe this is not due to the units themselves but instead TP-Link's update portal that the units use to check for updates. Checking on the main site reveals an update published on July 15 2021 (S4 2.0_en_1.5.0 Build 20210607 Rel. 56436_US_EU_AU_JP_up.bin) that is available which is one update newer than my currently applied firmware published on September 30 2020 (S4 2.0_en_1.4.3 Build 20200918 Rel. 77820_US_EU_AU_JP_up.bin). Looks like I will have to update the units manually using the download links provided by TP-Link and by logging into the web UI (note: each unit will have its own web UI but one - the master - will show a different one by showing you the topology of the mesh; a manual firmward update can be applied using that unit).= SummaryOverall this is a great product.  It definitely addresses the WiFi coverage in our new home.  It has only been a few days since I set them up.  However, a star in my rating had to be knocked off which will become evident shortly.  I may update this review after some more time has passed.  But it is currently appearing I might be returning this.I operate these in access point mode and not router mode.  I have a better router than what these units provide and do not need double NAT'ing on my house wide network.  That, and, I will be replacing the house wide router with a substantially better one anyway in the coming months.This review, however, covers my utilization and experience in both modes.  Also note that I am an IT professional and deal with network infrastructure (along with many other things) day to day for over 20 years.In this review the term “satellite” is used to denote a Deco unit that is not the main Deco unit.I have intentionally saved the worst points of my review as the last section.= Topology SetupI have fiber to the premise gateway, still with the gateways’ Wi-Fi fully enabled on both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz bands.  My home is over 2,650 sqft, single story, built this year, with gigabit Cat5e cables to each room the Deco S4 units are situated.  All Deco units use the Ethernet backhaul.  All Cat5e runs and cables have been tested to support gigabit speeds point-to-point (with of course the obligatory TCP/IP overhead).  Placement wise each of the Deco units are almost in a straight line, a function of my floor plan and where I need Wi-Fi coverage the most.  Relative distances between Deco units:- 25 linear feet between first satellite and second, main Deco unit with one interior door between.  This I refer to as satellite 1.- 45 linear feet between second satellite and main Deco unit with 3 interior only walls between.  This I refer to as satellite 2.= PerformanceThe throughput performance on these is fantastic, especially at the price point.  I have fiber gigabit Internet service.  I use speedtest.net for all bench marks.  I get the following throughput on a Samsung Galaxy Note 8 (US), stock firmware, latest software and security patches.  Distance is always the distance between my test device and a specific Deco unit and with line of sight between the test device and the target Deco unit.| Deco  | Distance | Downstream | Upstream |Satellite 1 | 1 ft  | 344  | 392  |Main  | 1 ft  | 446  | 389  |Satellite 2 | 1 ft  | 460  | 392  |Satellite 1 | 3 ft  | 279  | 422  |Main  | 3 ft  | 485  | 409  |Satellite 2 | 3 ft  | 392  | 383  |Satellite 1 | 6 ft  | 355  | 350  |Main  | 6 ft  | 477  | 390  |Satellite 2 | 6 ft  | 483  | 461  |Satellite 1 | 9 ft  | 361  | 475  |Main  | 9 ft  | 482  | 374  |Satellite 2 | 9 ft  | 477  | 466  |Satellite 1 | 12 ft  | 385  | 460  |Main  | 12 ft  | 451  | 458  |Satellite 2 | 12 ft  | 501  | 528  |Satellite 1 | 15 ft  | 445  | 389  |Main  | 15 ft  | 461  | 453  |Satellite 2 | 15 ft  | 500  | 432  |A 15 foot distance between a Deco unit and a connected device is most likely acceptable considering average housing room sizes.  However, in my house floor plan, I have an easy 25 foot line of sight from the main Deco unit to where I did a test.  Results came in as 251 Mbps downstream and 117 Mbps upstream.  Still, highly acceptable.  At my maximum floor plan range to that same Deco unit and still maintaining line of sight of 33 feet I wind up getting an unexpectedly impressive 493 Mbps downstream and 388 Mbps upstream.  While I cannot check in the app to see specifically which Deco unit my test device was connected to due to either app or overall product system issues, I am left with only one avenue of explanation: the Deco system has successfully performed link aggregation for my test device. If, in the first place, I am correct in this very poor conclusion due to the lack of data, then, this is indeed impressive and can very well be THE single most discriminator in overall product performance vs issues vs cost.I realize these performance tests are not representative of real world scenarios.  Fact is, most people do not go to such lengths to test their products and relevant environments, much less describe their environments.When a little more time goes by I will update this review with more realistic real world performance tests in terms of longer distances and obstructions.= The GoodI do not need parental controls, so, access point mode removes that for me, thankfully.  Because I operate this in access point mode not having quality of service on the Deco's is just fine as is not having DHCP handled by the Deco's.  Again, my current infrastructure handles all of these elegantly and more than sufficiently.In order to get a proper pass off while going from one end of the house to the other I had to enable fast roaming.  Without enabling this resulting in unbearably long hand offs from one unit to the other based on proximity to units.  The net result of this was severe performance degradation.  This seems to work without issue and solved the hand off issue.The app is straightforward to use and easy to understand, ranging from initial installation to adding additional Deco's to day to day activities.  The app also provides notifications of new devices when they are added to / detected on the network (both in router and access point modes).As expected you can define a main Wi-Fi network and a guest network.  This is standard fare.  You can select if you want both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands active or be more selective.  Again, this is standard fare.You can rename connected devices in the app.  Useful especially when connected devices do not allow you to set their DHCP host name.  The units try to profile a connected device type (e.g., Phone, PC, etc) in which the result of this is also easily accessible via the app.  But, when it cannot or gets it wrong you can override this in the app, very useful feature indeed.  The app will also show you basic information such as allocated IP address, MAC address (wish it was in colon delimited notation and not hypen as the former is the standard representation for MAC addresses), connection type (main or guest network and frequency band) and which Deco unit the device is currently linked to.Unfortunately you cannot get the same level of information regarding devices connected to the guest network.  Having visibility into this is just as important to give you another data point in your connected IoT devices.  Oh, yeah, I suppose that people visiting your home is good too.  Regardless, it is utterly unclear whether or not connected devices on the guest network have visibility to one another (e.g., can see each other), and much less have any reach into the main Wi-Fi or rest of your network.  At a minimum, the default of any guest Wi-Fi network should be nothing can see anything else on the guest Wi-Fi , cannot see the main Wi-Fi, cannot see the rest of your network and can only see the Internet.Any Deco unit can serve as the main.  In router mode, this means that the main unit has routing capabilities.  Likewise, a different unit can be specified as the main via the app.= The BadThere is no white listing of devices, only a black list.  Security best practice is white listing devices that are authorized for access.  Having only a black list is unacceptable.  It is on this ground alone these units may very well be returned.  It escapes me why TP-Link would fail to include the ability to white list.  Since this product seems to be targeted to the less network technologically bound than myself I can understand why only a black list is available (to prevent the less technologically adept folks from effectively locking themselves out).  However, not including a white list capability does an injustice to everyone and is, security wise, shameful and puts consumers’ home networks at additional unnecessary risk of exploitation.  Yes, using a white list to winds up meaning having to go through a little more trouble to allow a new device onto the network.  For me, and every other IT security professional out there, white listing is an essential tool in the security posture arsenal and is one that should never be omitted.The only firmware release is the initial firmware release: Deco S4(US)_V2_191023 from December 25, 2019 (TP-Link support site).  In the Deco app it reports no new updates for the firmware with a current version of 1.1.5 Build 20191023 Rel. 67285.  Unzipping the firmware release on the support site shows the same firmware version as the app shows (specifically: S4 2.0_en_1.1.5 Build 20191023 Rel. 67285_US_EU_AU_JP_up.bin).  Half a year later I would expect at least an additional firmware release.  While not having any could be a good thing, generally, this is never the case.  There are always bugs and vulnerabilities in every piece of software, and, firmware is no exception.  Clearly a firmware update is needed at least to add a white list feature.There is a barely usable web UI for the Deco's beyond that of just using the Deco app.  I have found a landing page for each Deco connected to my router via the IP assigned to each.  All UI's require authentication.  The UI is different depending on which Deco you connect to.  The Deco's that are not the main Deco provide the following features: update the firmware, pull the system log or reboot.  Accessing the system log allows you to save it, email it or clear it.  In contrast, connecting to the UI for the main Deco yields a subset of the features compared to the app but adds visibility into the units' CPU and memory usage.  Said subset of features are mainly read only via the interface, again, not very useful.  Thus there is no real point in using anything but the app if one is looking for access to more robust features.Connected device presence status (online / offline) is wholly inaccurate as reported by the app.  The only connected devices that are accurately reported for presence are those that have not left the Wi-Fi range and not power cycled.  For example, all of my Fire TV sticks show as being online but all mobile devices that left the Wi-Fi range now show as offline despite being back within Wi-Fi range of the units for several hours.  Even manually refreshing the view still yields in the app reporting these same mobile devices as being offline.  More testing still needs to be performed, but, there is no reason why the device list status page in the app is this inaccurate.Bandwidth utilization by connected device in the device list is great to have.  The only problem is that it too is completely inaccurate to the same degree as mentioned previously regarding connected device presence status.  For those devices that actually show as being online the bandwidth utilization shown in this same view is always 0Kbps up and downstream.  Since installation of the units I have yet to see this populated and have seen, once, and only once, a single connected device bandwidth utilization being reported if I select the said device in the list.There is no ability to perform a wireless site survey.There is no ability to use 802.11x.From a network management perspective there is no way to rename a specific Deco in terms of the host name that it will present to the rest of your network.  All units show up simply as ""deco-S4"" from DHCP.  Not useful.There is no way to designate the guest network LAN IP address range.= The UglyInitial set up was in router mode, the default.  Setup of main and satellite 1 Deco’s went flawlessly and took but a few minutes per.  Meanwhile, satellite 2 refuses to join the mesh in router mode and always leaves me staring at a red blinking light.  The app reports “Unable to add these Decos” and “Move these Decos closer to a Deco that you’ve already set up, then tap TRY AGAIN.”  Why would anyone have to move a Deco unit closer to another?  They have an Ethernet backhaul, and by definition, can communicate with each other!Meanwhile, the engineer within me takes a different stance: while all Deco units indeed have a gigabit Ethernet backhaul each unit must be able to verify a minimal Wi-Fi signal level from its closest neighbor.  And, since I am a customer facing type of person that voice inside of me would scream: in order to assure the best possible experience please ensure all Deco units have no physical obstructions between them and that none are surrounded by things that can block radio frequencies such as metal and concrete.Point is, I have yet to get all three Deco units online in router mode at all.  It is NOT an option to bring any units closer together.  Satellite 2 Deco has been power cycled and reset (via the reset button on the bottom of the unit) half a dozen times per with precisely the same results.Now, putting the system into access point mode results in a perfectly usable system without any of these problems.  Wish I knew why.  Regardless, this is a telltale sign to me of poor engineering.  Of course, switching system modes from router to access point (or vice versa) results in the system rebooting all Deco’s.  The majority of most modern residential Wi-Fi capable routers do not require a reboot when making this change.This is so problematic that it is cause, alone, for me to return the product.Read more"

I normally have 2 routers active; main router for all ethernet connected devices as well as providing VPN connection (Linksys WRT3200ACM); which also connects to the 2nd wireless router a netgear R7000 for my normal open WIFI for non VPN traffic and guests. Both routers are in the downstairs, centered, and work good. The VPN router/WIFI covers the areas of the house for fixed/PC/Laptop that use VPN; but the netgear providing clear WIFI couldn't cover the entire house with a usable signal; even though the R7000 is a very good high end wireless router. It covered MOST of the house, but none to the garage and very little outside front or back; and a couple of sketchy places in the house.I tried wifi extenders and even another router as an access point.

Great if you're going to a spot and staying there; but extenders and AP are not good if you're moving around. So, I went with a Mesh system; the TP-Link AXE5400 XE75. This has been awesome. Setup is easy, just follow the app instructions.I left my primary Linksys VPN router as is, and simply removed the Netgear R7000 and replaced it with the TP-Link. (Yes, double NAT is fine for 99% of traffic; IF the primary router, in my case the linksys, is set up properly to allow traffic flow to the TP-LINK to work properly). Anyway; the main TP-LINK router is where the netgear was, and I wireless connect the second slave node on the main floor. This is working great. My VPN linksys wired/wireless router still covers the 2 home offices that use the vpn; and most of the house for the other rare vpn occasions. The new TP-Link XE75, between the downstairs node and the main floor node, are covering every inch of the house, garage, back yard, and front yard. And being I gave it the SAME SSID name and password that the Netgear USED TO BE, I didn't have to change any settings in ANY of my wifi devices. Not even security cameras, Roku, AppleTV, phones, tablets, laptops, etc... All the devices were instant connections. And when I roam around the house, yard, deck, etc... the portable devices like phones and tablets transfer from the one node to the other node seamlessly. I was considering getting a 3rd node, but after using this for the last month, there's no reason to spend more money. This is the best setup I could have wanted. Definitely buy it if you need PORTABLE WIFI COVERAGE for phones, tablets, etc... that move around a lot.If your devices are pretty well fixed and don't move, like streaming tv boxes, smart tv, laptop/computer in an office, etc. then learn to better position your existing wifi router for better coverage or look into using an extender. Extenders are great if you're staying in one place; because it's shows a different SSID than the main and your device can't auto switch between them. But for fixed devices or scenarios where you stay put for long periods of time, extenders are great. Especially for the cost of the TP-Link. I got it on sale, but an extender is still much cheaper. But if you need the mesh technology so you can be more mobile with uninterrupted connections, then this is the mesh wifi for you.Read more"

Well, the price is so close to the WiFi 6 I'd go with it now to help future proof! I didn't check other vendors, and I don't have the WiFi 7. If I had to buy today, I'd do the WiFi 7 for sure.2-Pack WiFi 6 = $220 ($110 each)2-Pack Wifi 7 = $230 ($115 each!!!!!)3-pack, WiF 6 = $330 ($110 each)3-pack WiFi 7 = $300. ($100 each!!!!!!!)UPDATE 29-Sep-2024:I'm totally satisfied. ZERO issues, works beautifully. I had this at 4-Stars to start as installation and set-up went smoothly however I wanted time for it to ""bake-in"" with use., now I'm at 5-Stars.There is a TP WiFi 7 model available that does cost less than other vendors, still expensive though.The WiFi 6E was $188 for the pair, WiFi 7 is $449 for a pair. That's a big jump, and yes, from what I've read you'll get higher performance. The question that needs to be asked: Do you need it for the extra price? If you can easily afford it, no reason not to.I've worked for 30 years as a network design/architect/consultant in the carrier industry. As described below, for my requirements the TP WiFi 6E is perfect. In 5 years, I may need to look into upgrading to a higher grade mesh. By then, prices will come down for a WiFi 7 and maybe when WiFi 8 is out that'll be a consideration.For now, WiFi 6E works. I give routers a 5-year life span as tech improves rapidly, but do you need annual upgrades? Not in my world, yet. I'm still waiting for 5G cellular service in my rural setting yet I do get 80Mbps down/19Mbs up (Verizon), and in some places in Colorado Springs I've clocked 1.3Gbps on my iPhone which is insanely fast. My iPhone does provide good hotspot backup if needed.If you have a ""Brady Bunch"" size family, maybe the WiFi 7 would better, and you may need more than 2 routers in the mesh depending on your house, basement, patio, number of devices and floors.The nice thing about the TP mesh is adding more as needed is easy, as it should be today.GENERAL: 16-Sep-2024I needed a new WiFi mesh solution. I'll explain why in a bit.For 99% of the users at home, basic settings should be fine. For those with bespoke setting requirements, they know what needs to be done. This isn’t a commercial grade device like from Cisco or Meraki although for small offices, I think the XE75 would be excellent.DETAILS TO CONSIDER:I’m using the TP Deca XE75 – be SURE to know this, not Deco AXE5400 as this is not a choice when registering via the app. I use just a pair in a 3,800’ slab-on-grade ranch. Each XE75 works at 2.4/5/6Ghz. There are 3 “Networks”: Router, Guest and IOT to isolate connections. Pricing was excellent at $219 for the pair + a $30 discount coupon! This is not a Base plus Extender, these are both full-function WiFi routers with the first one setup being the Main. They each have 3 UTP Gbit ports. I only needed UTP on the Main.Password, frequencies, ect settings are all transparent across the mesh network. You can click on each Wifi router in the mesh to see what is connected to each.Each SSID will have its own password. Be sure to use Upper/lower/a few numbers/a few special characters, and MAKE SURE TO JOT THEM DOWN!SSID Router and Router_6Ghz + Password you create - iPhone, laptop, printer, SAN/NASSSID Guest + Password you create: if I have visitorsSSID IOT + Password you create: all other connections like Hunter-Douglas PowerView (motorized Roman shades), TVs, 22KW Generac generator, DTV, DVD, etc that have vendor access for updates and such.SETUP:SUGGESTION: Unplug your ISP equipment before you start setting up the app. My iPhone just downloaded via my Verizon cell connection nicely. This gives your ISP equipment the 5 or more minutes to quiesce (shutdown, clear). When I connected to my ISP equipment and powered-up, I called my ISP, they saw the new device, authorized and in a few seconds I was back on-line.Download the TP App, and follow the instructions step-by-step.When setting up, each XE75 has a barcode on the bottom that needs to be scanned as you set them up – easier than typing in the code. It’s a tad fuzzy to scan, just don’t give up. I used an iPhone 13 Pro to scan and was surprised how difficult it was. Just follow the instructions at setting up the router EXACTLY (keyword=EXACTLY) as they say. The app will ask you to name it, I used Office from the choices, and I think you could do a custom name.With my ISP, I have to call and tell them a new router is being connected so they can authorize it for security. My ISP is a local company in Colorado, Kellin, that services remote areas hence microwave (plans in the next 12-18 months include going up-to 500Mbps - way more than I need), and support is seriously fantastic after more than 10 years. The UTP ports (3 on each route) support 1Gbps. The TP should work for all ISP, probably even StarLink although check first to be sure.The App set-up worked great as I followed the instructions EXACTLY as they specified.Next, I created PASSWORDS for Office, Guest and IOT networks.Next, I added the other XE75 to the mesh using the barcode reader, and boom, up it came, connected to the mesh and I named it Bedroom. On the App you’ll see: ISP icon---Office/MAIN icon----Bedroom icon (these are my locations) plus you’ll see how many devices are connected to each with a footnote number for each. Nice.Next, I started discovery for Router – my laptop runs at 6Ghz. BTW, UTP connections go to Router only that I can tell, not Guest or IoTNext, I started discovery for IOTNo Guests yet, however, they should connect as easilyUnder “More Settings” at the lower right corner of the app, click and you’ll see Wi-Fi Setting (Main Network), then Guest Network and IoT Network. Pretty straight forward; naming Wi-Fi Setting the same as the Main Network would make better sense at least to me.In Wi-Fi and Guest Networks you have 2.4/5Ghz and 6Ghz network options. In IoT you only have 2.4/5Ghz.I turned off 6Ghz for Guest as 2.4/5Ghz will be fine plus you’ll get better distance and plenty of bandwidth performance.If I need to connect my laptop to Guest or IoT, my laptop selects the highest frequency. My iPhone 13 doesn’t do 6Ghz. When I upgrade my iPhone in a year or 2, it’ll probably have 6Ghz.PERFORMANCE:My microwave ISP is 120Mbps Up/Down, plenty for me. I don’t game or have kids. I work from home as a consultant, do WebEx/Zoom/MS Teams video calls that are excellent quality, I’ll watch an Amazon Prime movie now and then, I use DirecTV not a streaming or cable service. So far, performance has been flawless. Generac has “issues” with mesh networks – this is on them to fix as it is 2024 and it is not a $50 device, but that is for another review. (Generac works great, it’s the 2.4Ghz WiFi set-up that is archaic.) If you do have a Generac, the best way is if the remote mesh router is near the Generac, turn it off and force the Generac to connect to the Base. Then, bring the remote router(s) back on-line. This seems to fix the stupid problem. And yes, it is stupid for a $17,000 device as it should have a great WiFi solution, it doesn’t. This is a problem for Generac with all mesh networks, not just TP. I did a lot of research and found a good work-around solution Reddit.For the price and performance, I think you’ll like this device. I only have the main and 1 remote. More remotes, no idea. My video calls, streaming with Amazon Prime (Netflix should be OK, I don’t have it) and gaming should be fine (I don’t game). Another thing that will affect performance over the Internet will be your ISP’s quality. They say like 1-Gig service however, that is the max you’ll probably get. During busy times performance may degrade based on how many people they support – it gets complicated with over-subscription to bandwidth during peak hours. Clearly, more users will be on between like 6PM and Midnight than at 1PM or 3AM in a residential area: streaming movies and gaming uses a LOT of bandwidth. That 1 Gig you subscribe to is not 100% all the time. This has nothing to do with TP or a home set-up.AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT – Why TP?2.4/5/6Ghz: What’s the difference? The higher the frequency, the more data that can be transmitted. Problem is, as the frequency goes up the ability to penetrate walls drops. 2.4Ghz carries less data however it penetrates walls better than 5Ghz and 6Ghz. I won’t get all wonky. Extenders are the reason they are needed in large houses/multiple floors to penetrate hence we have mesh networks today as single WiFi devices have distance problems at higher frequencies as more data is needed like for gaming, video, streaming, phone calls, ect all at the same time.I had to replace my Netgear Orbi 850 w/1 satellite. The Base unit UTP ports stopped working which means I lost ISP access and UTP devices. My hardware warranty ended 7 weeks prior. I paid over $600 in July 2023. I contacted sales to see if I could buy a refurb'ed 850 base at a decent discount. Nope. They just said your hardware warranty has ended - I was up-front and told them that. I connected my laptop to my ISP and it came right up. They wanted to troubleshoot. Waste of time. Duh. I’ve used Netgear for over 20 years, routers, WiFi and LAN switches. I upgrade when needed. This Orbi 850 issue and how they handled it was poor. This wasn’t a $50 device. And, now I have an Orbi 850 satellite I need to sell on eBay, the base will get recycled. Will I ever buy Netgear again? Extremely unlikely. I like the LAN switches, solid, reliable, lifetime warranty on the ProSafe products however I have all the Gigabit LAN switches I need as WiFi speeds get better.I tried the eero Pro 6E mesh Wi-Fi router, $184.00 + 20% rebate + $100 credit sending my Orbi back. Great deal. My ISP recommended eero. The set-up was a tad awkward (I wrote a review) and I got through it. Connected my devices and all. I noticed my laptop had really poor performance and disconnects. I decided to buy the eero Extender & wall mount total $95, neat set-up. Got it, however, my laptop kept going to the base router, never the Extender. The problem was the Extender only handles 2.4/5Ghz, not 6Ghz. I have no way to disable 6Ghz on my laptop, this is a deficiency and Lenovo support was no help. I called for eero support to see if a 2.4/5/6Ghz extender was available or if I could disable 6Ghz on the Base Router. No to each question. At least TP allows you to disable 6Ghz. The recommendation: buy a 2nd eero Pro 6E mesh Wi-Fi router, and now the price ~7 days later was $249. Not having an Extender at 2.4/5/6Ghz when the base equipment does is silly given we are now seeing WiFi 7 being released (EXPENSIVE though). I sent the eero stuff back for a refund. Had the eero Extender provided 6Ghz, I would have kept it as it did work really well, 2.4/5Ghz is fine for my house, and a new laptop would have cost a LOT more.If your device doesn’t do 6Ghz, eero would be fine. However, as with all technology we’ll see upgrades with new devices in the coming years. If you have a device that can’t disable 6Ghz, you'll have a problem.If you are still awake, I hope this helped.Read more"

They complained about ""my Internet"" for years. Works great for the wife and me, but the grandkids were not happy. So I decided to try a mesh system.I read a lot about the various mesh systems out there and decided to give the eero system a try. I decided on the 6+ system because it was the latest release and the price was right for three units. The Pro line was just too expensive; for $400 more I did not see a real advantage.Two days after ordering the eero routers arrived. I quickly unboxed and disconnected the Netgear router and remote Access point that I placed on the upper floor.Our house is about 2,800 square foot ranch. The Internet comes into the basement. I placed the first eero router where the old Netgear router was sitting, connected it to the cable modem, then added power to the eero and used the eero app on my iPhone to begin setting it up. Set-up went pretty quick on the first unit. I then connected the open port on the main eero router to a Netgear switch. The Netgear switch is then connected to a MoCA adapter to give me wired Ethernet connections in three other locations in the house.  Those three locations also have Netgear switches connected through MoCA adapters. All but one MoCA are 2.5v and one is a 1.1v MoCA.Next I put the second unit upstairs on top of a dry sink cabinet and set that one up with the app which went quickly. Finally, the third app was placed in one of the two bedrooms the grandkids like to use when visiting.Now I started to do speed tests in different rooms and locations throughout the house. I will honestly tell you that at first, I was not impressed. I expected better speeds/bandwidth then what I was seeing. Since only the main router had a wired connection, the other two units relied on a wireless connection back to the main router.  In some cases I was only seeing about 50Mbs in most of the upstairs areas. Ugh!Then I decided to check the speed/bandwidt on my main computer which had a wired connection using a MoCA adapter back to a small Netgear switch next to the main eero router. I was only getting ~150Mbs! That was a ""WTF"" moment as it should have been around 400Mbs which is the bandwidth I have from the Internet provider.More frustration, but I put that issue on hold for a bit. I started moving the two upstairs eero devices around to different rooms and locations. Sometimes they improved, sometimes not. Frustration.Then I decided to move one of the eero devices to the media cabinet where I had a small Netgear switch connected to a MoCA adapter which of course went back to a MoCA adapter connected to the main eero router. I did not do this originally because I tried to locate the two upstairs eero devices as centrally in the house as possibly.That really changed things. Suddenly I was getting better speed and bandwidth from not only the wired upstairs eero device ~400Mbs, but also to the second wireless eero device. So now I had a better wireless signal with the wireless eero device.Then back to the main computer. Still only ~150Mbs. For grins I had a moment where a light went off....let me try shutting the power off to the 1.1v MoCA adapter. Checked the speed on the main computer again, and over 400Mbs. Now I knew that MoCA was backwards compatible, but after this I did some reading. What I missed is that when you mixed versions, the entire MoCA Ethernet will go to the bandwidth of the older MoCA in use. Makes sense now, but what did not make sense was that they same set-up was being used pre-eero install and was not an issue. Then when I reconnected power to the 1.1v MoCA, the speed not the main computer was still at ~400Mbs. I cannot explain that, but I did order a cheap Trendnet 2.5v MoCA from Amazon and replaced the old version so that now all MoCA adapters were at version 2.5.Since everything seemed to be running well now, I just experimented with placement of the remaining eero unit that was being used wirelessly seeing where I got the best speed when devices were connected to it. Finally settled on the guest bedroom.The last thing I did was change the IP addresses and range to match what I had on the old Netgear routers and even assigned four of the hardware devices fixed IP addresses as before.The grandkids have stopped complaining about the WiFi. I am also very happy.I should also add that when the grandkids are not here, we have close to 70 devices connected to the network such as Echo devices in each room, iPhones, iPads, Fire Tablets, TVs, Fire TV units. several computers including Raspberry Pi units (my ham radio hobby related Pi's), home automation with a Habitat and God only knows what else.My advice if you buy the eero system. Do not get discouraged if you run into issues. Keep trying. Mine was a bit more complicated because of the MoCA Ethernet network and all the devices I have connected. Yours may go in much easier. Try to use a wired connection to at least one eero on each floor of your home. Also keep moving the eero devices around for best placement and speed/bandwidth.If you have issues and questions, eero has great community forums. I never asked any questions, but did use the forums to locate issues/suggestions that others had which helped me quite a bit. In summary, I am very happy with the eero 6+ system.Read more"

However, you need to have cell reception in order to register and set up the eero mesh network gateway. This is not the case where I live because I have terrible cell reception. I found a very helpful post that explained how to keep your old router active and plug in the eero Gateway through the ethernet port of the old router in order to get signal to set up the new Gateway. Once that was set up, I took away the  old router, rebooted the modem and the gateway, and it was smooth sailing.Most of the connections went fairly smoothly. I kept the same network name and password and anything from that network connected rather seamlessly.I did have to go into each Smart home app to reconnect any devices now that the mesh system works on dual band rather than separate SSID distinctions. My echo devices seemed to know what to do. Anything on the 2.4 had to have network name and password set up since it all operates on one network.My first complaint is that the 6+ mesh network is dual band and anything that requires 2.4 GHz needs some extra help. In settings under troubleshooting, you can disable the 5 GHz band temporarily while connecting the 2.4 GHz devices. It’s not completely obvious unless you poke around in the app. This was very helpful until it came to the my Q garage door opener.My biggest complaint and the he reason for only 4 stars, is that there is a known issue that the eero 6 networks do not play well with MyQ devices. It is disappointing because Amazon key delivery relies heavily on MyQ openers. I did a deep dive through Google to find possible solutions. There are several listed and I’ve tried each one. In fact, when you google MyQ + eero, you will see a slew of sites that discuss the exact problem and possible solutions.  This included temporarily disabling the 5 GHz band, disabling WPA 3 in the developer options, unplugging any additional mesh nodes other than the gateway, using your old router as a bridge through the gateway, uninstalling the MyQ app and downloading again, forgetting the original device and adding it from scratch. None of those worked for me. I am stuck on the “searching for available networks” screen and no further. It does not even let me see ANY networks or choose them.The MyQ worked flawlessly until installing the eero. I wish Amazon had 1) made the issue known on the product page and 2) worked a little further with MyQ to troubleshoot this issue for a solution prior to calling this a human friendly set up item. I purchased the MyQ from Amazon, so an algorithm to search past purchases for MyQ and shopping cart additions could have led to a warning before spending so much money and time for a customer.For anyone without a MyQ, and looking for simple “plug and play”, this is a good option. My coverage is way better than before with using extenders. Speeds are very good. Re-integrating my smart devices was mostly painless after discovering the temporarily disable 5 GHz feature.I love the speeds and coverage a lot. Eero has good tech support though they couldn’t solve my one big issue. Outside of that issue, this is a good network. At least for the two days I’ve been using.Read more"

Setup was shockingly easy; I used the Tether app on my phone and had it up and running in less than ten minutes. The signal indicator light is a great feature that helped me find the perfect outlet halfway up the stairs for the best performance. Now, we have full bars upstairs and can stream in HD without any issues. I even plugged our old smart TV into the ethernet port, and it feels faster than ever. My only minor complaint is that since I don't have a TP-Link OneMesh router, it creates a separate extended network. This means sometimes I have to manually switch my phone's WiFi to the extender's network when I go upstairs. It's not a huge deal, but not quite seamless. For the price, however, it's an incredible value and solved a major headache for us. Highly recommended for targeting specific weak spots in your home.Read more"

Setting up the new Eero devices using the iPad app was so easy!  Connecting to the cable modem worked after rebooting the modem.  Switching all my Apple devices was a snap and the eero app makes it easy to see those devices.  A bit more challenging to switch my AirPrint printer over, but once I found some general instructions online, I had it working in less than a minute.  The only thing left to swap is my Windows laptop but at this point I’m pretty optimistic.  I also love that eero monitors my internet speed and I can check that in the app, as well.Read more"

After speaking with the terrible man with customer service, he did help resolve the issue & we have not had any issues since customer service walked me through resetting everything. I am happy with the Eero. But the customer service experience was still a very bad one.I was so happy when we received the Eero, it's sleek & pretty & worked well too... for the first 2 weeks. We decided on the mesh system since we have a wing of the house that is far away & it was not getting any internet signal but the Eero took care of that with the 2nd device & the signal in that wing was strong. We were thrilled that the other wing of the house now was connected. But after 2 weeks, the entire system kept going on & off, on & off. I spoke with Spectrum our cable provider first convinced it was an issue with our cable service since the Eero was brand new. Spectrum confirmed that the signals were not as good as they could be so they sent out a technician who trouble shot & then our internet worked again for a few days. Issues again so we would reboot & it would work for a couple hours & then repeat the same problem. I spoke to Spectrum again & they sent another technician out. The 2nd technician went so far as to put in new lines to the house since he said there could be problem there, he was nice enough to work on this for a good 2 hrs & then said that there might be a problem with some part on the top of some tower so he had a truck come out & change that out. All of this while I'm telling them that it isn't a problem with the router since the router works when the cable works. Again, everything worked for another 3-4 days & then out again. 3rd technician came out & confirms all signals are good & that there is nothing more they can do so it's got to be the router so he leaves a Spectrum router & has the Eero go through the spectrum router. He said if it fails in the next 48 hrs it's the Eero. Within 48 hrs, everything stops working again & I did what the last technician instructed me to do & disconnected the Eero all together. The technician had me only use their Spectrum router & everything worked. So the problem was definitely the router. Now it could have been the internet service provider as well & the Eero may need to have been rebooted etc so I called in to customer service to make this thing work since again, I want this thing to work. Otherwise we have a problem with the wing that needs a boost & no booster we have used has worked in the past. Only the Eero has worked. The guy on customer service had to be one of the rudest men I have ever spoken with on the phone. I understand that not all representatives are indicative of the type of service you will get but I suffered with his condescension since I need this thing to work & I had already put in so much time. When I asked him at the end if I run into this problem again how to get a new system. He flatly said that is not possible. So it seems I will have to just pray that this thing does not keep having this problem. It's been just over 30 days since I bought this thing so outside the return window. The reason for my 1 star is the fact that this thing has caused us insane headaches for several weeks, everyone works from home now & needs reliable internet! can you imagine the frustration? & then the rude customer service when I called to get assistance & do add insult to injury the fact that I can't get a replacement. I wasn't even asking to return. I would not recommend this at all & I would look into another mesh system that has a better return or replacement policy since I understand there are lemons out there which is why I am so irritated that they just won't replace it with a new one since it seems I got a dud.Read more"

It literally increased my signal strength and boosted up my mpbs almost threefold and that is no joke. The price here on Amazon is amazing and let's put it this way this device on the box claims it will do a 5-6 bedroom house and it definitely will. I only have a three-bedroom house and this device can definitely work for a house almost twice my size. I have included pictures The first one that shows an HDTV is from the TP link app running speed on average which is definitely good enough for streaming 4K movies and the other is from my cell so you make the call but you would definitely not be disappointed with this. Long story short, my Wi-Fi router was only reaching about 300 ft and I believe that these devices can reach anywhere from 900 to a thousand feet per node and each one of these can work in series so you can expand your Wi-Fi coverage even further. Example some systems can expand your coverage but have to be connected directly to the router either utilizing it ethernet cable or Wi-Fi connected so it can expand your coverage but not this device you use one of the nodes for the new Wi-Fi router and it doesn't matter which one you use, use the included ethernet cable unplug your modem plug in your ethernet cable to either port on the back of the TP-Link node and the other on the back of the LAN port from your modem and then plug your TP link node into the wall receptacle along with your modem/modum router combo and then power them both up at the same time. Once done you have to download the app and there is a QR code and a website that you go to for either iOS or Play store and the app has instructions to follow step by step and once you're up and running you're good to go with that one and your new node connected acts as your new Wi-Fi router with faster and better coverage. All the other existing nodes that you have all you have to do is put it in a location where your signal is weak hopefully somewhere between the Wi-Fi router and that dead zone so you still have a little bit of Wi-Fi and it will shock you because the new TP-Link node actually reaches out a lot further than your Wi-Fi router so depending on what Wi-Fi device you're connected and how close you are you may actually have Wi-Fi coverage covering the area that used to be dead. But hooking up another node would definitely expand it at least through your whole house literally. I can't say enough about these I had one time or a show I think buffered for about 2 seconds and that was it did not buffer again and I believe that was at the very beginning before the show loaded on my TV but most of the time it is really responsive and does not cut out or buffer and reaches so far that it is unreal. The speed that you get with this remember it's also limited onto how much speed you're actually paying for through your internet provider so keep that in mind. It shipped really quickly and I definitely got it on time and Amazon has literally saved me from having to spend hundreds of dollars on a new mesh Wi-Fi router to do my whole home with this new mesh Wi-Fi router combo it makes it so simple to hook up and honestly I have never hooked up a Wi-Fi router and set it up in my life. The internet provider when they installed it they hooked it up and set it up and I've never had to mess with it until now. Something to think about but definitely definitely I cannot say that enough this is worth a try as you would not be disappointed. And as for people who do gaming I don't but my stepson does and when he comes over and brings his PS5 there is no lag the picture is so crystal clear he was actually shocked that this works a lot better than my original Wi-Fi router so something to think about and he's a young adult.Read more"

Setup easy, app really good, Ethernet backbone is killer","I'm an IT geek / software developer for a living.  I know all about how this stuff works and I wanted fast, but I didn't need crazy expensive for my home and some of these mesh systems are way overpriced IMHO.  Reality is you can have all the latest crazy standards but once you get 20ft from the access point all bets are off and you'll never see the speeds you see quoted so you need to mix practical with price.  There seem to be sooo many mesh system options these days, that I was overwhelmed, but after some consideration I thought I would just go for this one which seemed reasonably priced, but still offered most of the latest standards (and thus speed limits) and also had free returns!In this case this config with 2 slave units was great for my ~4500 sq ft house, my previous single access point left some dead spots (like my Ring outside the house) just outside the range. But with this setup I can blanket the house and get pretty good speeds (>100-200Mb throughput) just about everywhere, and faster (400+ when you are reasonably close / line of sight to the access point)It's important to remember when thinking about laying these out in your house what and where you need the speed.  If you need speed inside your house (say you are always streaming movies from a pc to another device) or if you need speed from a device to the internet. The slave access points can only provide as much throughput back to the main access point (which is probably directly plugged into your router/internet) as good as their own wireless connection is to EACH OTHER.  eg:  if you put the slave access points 50ft away they might ""only"" be able to get like 20Mb back to the internet, as your devices is going from device -> slave access point ->* main access point (next to your router/internet) and the * connection is the weak link.  What was the killer feature for me on these is you can actually use ethernet as a backbone for the slave access points.  My house is pre-wired with ethernet so I was able to put the slave access points pretty far but every slave is hardwired back to the main access point and thus has 100% of the throughput back to the internet so no matter which access point you connect to in the house each access point is as fast as the main one so the access point to access point speed drop is a non-issue if you can set it up like this.  DO THIS IF AT ALL POSSIBLE!  It's like having 3 ""full speed"" access points strategically dropped through your house.  It wasn't obvious I could do this from the (very basic) docs for setup that came with it, but a quick search through the online docs showed you could this and it's brain dead, just plug your home network into the port on the back.  Extra bonus feature, you can use the 2nd port on the back as a local hardwired port so if you have a single PC or ""device"" (like an xbox or something) next to the access point you can still plug it in directly and get full hard-wired speed without needing to buy an extra switch in the middle.  Note: If you don't use the 1st port for the backbone, then you get 2 ports for local devices that will get at least Access Point -> Access Point speeds without one more wifi hop needed.I was pretty impressed with the iPhone app that you use to manage the setup, gone are the days of a webbrowser hitting a super slow admin page, the app is snappy and you can tweak all kinds of stuff.  (favorite feature: One of the access points ended up in a kids room and they complained about the LED at night, guess what, turns out there's a ""night mode"" where it turns off the LED's during a timewindow in the settings pages!)The ""mesh"" part works really good too, from the app you can see your device move from access point to access point and what devices are on which and stuff.  Super handy for initial setup troubleshooting and geeking out over how it's all working.I will admit, I was a little nervous since TP-Link is sort of a more bargain brand in my head, but I've had it going for about 8 weeks now in my house and it's been basically flawless.  I'm sold, I'd TOTALLY buy this again or recommend it to a friend (or anyone reading this)!Read more"

The set up is easy to follow and straight forward. I did have a minor issue, but that was on my end and my service provider was able to give me the correct information needed to set up.It has been running now for about 4 months and we have had steady connection across all devices - computers, TVs, gaming systems, smart home and surveillance systems. The back room that was often a dead zone now gets a good strong signal.I like that I am able to hard wire certain devices into each unit if I want to. We currently have the main home computer connected to the second unit, and the Xbox and smart TV on the third unit. Not that any of these devices were experiencing any lag or connection issues on wifi.It also has the option to set specific devices to priority on wifi or to set a device to only connect to one unit rather than the mesh to maintain a steady connection on items that are stationary.The parental controls are also a great feature. You do need to pay to unlock everything, but the free features are enough for my needs. It allows to filter content, block websites, and set up screen limits. The only inconvenience on the free side is that you cant set multiple time limits for differentdays of the week. While I can set a bed time daily, if I want to give extra time on the weekend I do need to manually reset it every week. However, it is not a big deal with the app. Wifi to all devices you set to your child's profile will be turned off at the time you set, and not turn back on until a time you set. Bedtime routines have gotten smoother as they quickly learned there is no ""just a minute"". They now take note of the time and hurry to finish, save their progress and say goodbye to friends before the time runs out.Read more"

I had 200 MBs and that was more than enough for me. I had Google Wifi (gen1) for about 5 years. No problems except I had to buy extra pod to strengthen the signal (i live in condo and i have brick walls). So the signal from my balcony room (storage with concrete walls) was poor to my office. I bought nest wifi and everything was working good (connection was great / good) between nest wifi (router gen2) to 2 google wifi (gen1). I notice that after I got 1 GBs from ISP my speed was still the same 100 MBs on wifi. When I disconnected gen 1s (routers) my speed next to router (testing on iphone 14pro) was 560 MBs. If I would probably just switch my old 2 google wifi (gen 1) to Nest Wifi (gen2) I would be just fine. But since I live in condo I was like let me try that new 6Ghz.So I bought Nest Wifi Pro 3pk. Signal between 3 of them is great. If I would just use 2 it would be “Good signal”. I live in 1500 sqft apt, but my main router is basically in concrete storage (maybe I will drill a whole and put that router inside apt and give update).Speed next to Nest Wifi pro (gen3) router seems to be the same as Nest Wifi (gen2) what I am trying to say is I wouldn’t upgrade if all my previous pods were Nest Wifi (gen2). I wouldn’t expect more than 600 MBs on this routers based on my research online. What I like about google is steady speed, and they are upgrading software for this Nest Wifi Pro (so in future it will get better)Wifi speeds:Shed 500-600 MBs download / 22 MBs upload wifi speedWorkout Room about 300 MBsOffice 150-300 MBsOverall I don’t play a lot of games. Tried for CS 2 and ping was good, no lags in game.Streaming videos for 6hrs no buffering problems.Overall:If are upgrading from Google Wifi yea thats upgrade. I would not suggest upgrading Nest Wifi (only if you experience network problems or want to see if wifi will be stronger but I don’t see this wifi hitting more than 600 Mbs). Who needs more than 1 GBs internet.Design:I don’t really care about it but looks like nice stone (gen3). If its goes about power connector I am not a fan of it. Gen 1 had better in my opinion because if you connect to multiple plug connector it easy.Missing:Nest WiFi pro use 1 GBs Ethernet/WAN speed (that wire entry) while competition use 2.5 GBs Ethernet/WAN speed. On the other hand who use Ethernet anymore? Gaming desktops and maybe playstation.  But going forward I believe it will be all Wifi at some point.Signal:Seems to be better than Google WiFi (gen 1 and gen 2)Software:I had recently update on this which means google is working on this router. Maybe It will get better in future.Installation:Very easy on Google Home app. If you use the same wifi password and name, all your devices will connect automatically. However 3rd took me about 5 tries but finally was added.Price: Very Good compare to others. If you need 4pk see costco.Update from 14 January 2024:I found that moving modem and router from my storage/heating closet to open (without obstruction of concrete/brick walls) inside apartment made increased speed of 400-600 Mbps per second. The farther away pod goes 400+ Mbps. (On 1gb internet for comcast)I don’t see any issues with this system. I changed my 4 starts to 5 stars.Read more"

Finally the WIFI just stopped altogether after 2.5 yrs, and it was time for something else.This system is AMAZING - lots of dinged reviews are for compatibility with older systems, hodge-podge setups - maybe that's a problem, but for us it was perfect.I LOVE the REDUNDANCY built into the system:  Got the three pack, one for each floor.  If any of the units bites the dust, I can physically connect ANY of the three to the ISP line and it becomes the main node, and my house can survive on two (probably even one).  Bought three as it was much cheaper per unit (130/each vs 180 each alone).I was worried during the setup that it said that they should not be placed more than ""2 rooms"" apart, but had no problems putting one per floor, opposite ends of the house.  My worst node is ""good"" vs ""great"".  Setup took a little while to find the internet, just let my phone do it's thing for 5minutes and it was done.  Each unit took another 5 or so, so in <20 minutes, the whole house was covered!The WIFI is AMAZING - even though I had a ""high end"" system from 2.5 yrs ago, they've improved the signal, so now we get WiFi6 throughout not just our whole house....but our entire property as well.  No more cutting out in the driveway or garden!  Got to take down our extender, which caused problems because of the different network name - now just one name EVERYWHERE.Folks have complained that there weren't multiple Ethernet jacks per unit (lists two, but one is in, one is out), but if you can get cheap ethernet splitters to go off of that if needed.So for us, absolutely perfect!  Only ding would be the price ...an unexpected $400 to keep the house going, but could have probably made it work with fewer units, and I'm cheap, so anything would have been too much.Read more"

First, I have an old 3 story house with lathe and plaster walls. I had an Orbi system with 5 satellites that worked really well once it was set up (a whole other story). My router died and the series was discontinued. I thought (stupidly) that i would migrate my entire EIFI mesh to Google as I like thier app and interface (versus Orbi's which is garbage). So, I invest in 3 of these nest wifi Pro's. Install went great, they talk to each other, ok. They are supposed to cover 2200sq ft. Now, we all know that is with a million caveats to cover thier rear ends, but I figurede I would get 50% of that, so I should be pushing 3300ft sq. Sure. So, I figured that I had 5 Orbi's, so 6 Nests seems reasonable. So, I buy 3 MORE! for a total of 6. That should be 6600 sq ft. (2200/2 * 6) right? Coverage is ok, but still a bit laggy. So I double down. If 6 is good, 9 is better!!! I should be covering the entire block! Man, I get great signal everywhere. But it is so freaking laggy that is darn near useless. The little google app says ""you have great signals"", and yet everything stalls, trouble connecting, torubvle stayiing connected. Im sure I have some interferences someplace, but man this is crap. My Orbi systrem, once set up, was an absolute champ. This system, well I have 9 pods for sale!Read more"

No more. I had an ultra-expensive router at my home a few years ago when a friend asked me to come help him install this system in his new home. I did and it was easy to install--and it gave him fine speed for his needs, adequately covering a 6000 sq. ft home. My ultra-router has been nothing but a pain in the years since while this Netgear ultra-cheap mesh set has just plugged away, performing reliably well in my friend's house.So when I needed a router for my vacation cottage, this is what I bought--a refurbished mesh set for dirt cheap, and it's working just fine. I like the fact that I can manage the vacation cottage's router from home. But most of all, I like that it's cheap, reliable and sufficiently fast to handle my 300 megabits/second service.Really, this is all most of us will ever need. And in the recent past I've spent over $500 on a single router. The only thing this set seriously lacks is wired ethernet that goes faster than 1gb/sec.Read more"

It wasn't the easiest mesh to set up, you legitimately need to follow the steps very carefully, otherwise you'll have to reset all three devices and start from scratch.Once all three devices are set and it has gone through it's software updates, the mesh system works flawlessly.Coming from a TP link mesh system, this is a huge upgrade; the switch between the main modem and the satellite connections is seamless, the speeds are excellent, the ability to connect a device on Ethernet to the satellite for faster speeds is amazing.All three satellites are sleek, they mesh well with the decor of my house, there's no antennas or flashy lights everywhere. I 3d printed a bracket for one of them and mounted it on a wall, out of sight and out of mind.The app works great, if for some reason you need to reboot the router, monitor who's using all your bandwidth, or stop your kids from using data on their Xbox when they should be studying, you can do it from there.Read more"

Can't recommend.,"I purchased this in August of 2023 on Wirecutter's recommendation. The first six months were great. Good speeds, setup only moderately frustrating, and a decent price.It's now January 2023 and my router has stopped assigning IP addresses properly. If I try to connect via DHCP, it never finds an IP address. I have power cycled; I have done a factory reset; I have changed the range of IP addresses assigned; I have used my google-fu as best I can. I can only connect to wireless if I assign a static IP. I've looked at the logs and I can't see anything that changed that would cause this problem. It's been on the same firmware since I purchased it, and that's the most recent version.This wouldn't normally be that big of a deal, but: I use a lot of smart switches. I love a cozy room but I don't want to turn 12 lamps on and off manually. Giving each of them a static IP address *once* would be a PITA. Plus, the first advice that Netgear offers for troubleshooting is ""do a factory reset"". Then I'd have to reassign the static ip's all over again.I haven't even come to the worst part. NETGEAR DOES NOT OFFER CUSTOMER SUPPORT after 3 months unless you pay them. That's right. They want to charge me for troubleshooting a product that has failed within 6 months of purchase.This product has become a waste of money and a source of endless frustration. I don't even feel right giving it away and handing the problem off to someone else. It's literally just trash now.Do yourself a favor and buy literally anything else.

Please read....,"I read all the reviews before I bought, talked to a family friend who is an electrical engineer, talked with a friend who deals with computer systems for companies, and then just took a gamble!Installation was super simple. We just built a new house. With basement, it’s about 4,500 sq ft. Our modem is in the back corner of the house, in the basement. Even though we up’d our Xfinity signal to 1,000 Mbs, the signal in our house was pretty sad. Because of COVID, we have 2 kids virtual learning, me virtually teaching with 3 computers, and my wife doing secure law office work downstairs. We also have an extensive Ring camera system working around and through the house. On top of that, we have OneLink Safe & Sound devices on on all 3 floors! There’s a lot of stuff going on here. The first test I did I was standing a room away by the front door, which is around a corner from the unit. The signal speeds were off the charts! Then I went to the garage and driveway(pic1&2), amazing! I re-set up the ring camera out there to the TP mesh system and did a speed test through the Ring app. Much different numbers, but the signal was the highest it’s ever been without an extender in the garage (pic3)! Next, out of curiosity, I went to the sidewalk out front, check out the signal through TP app (pic4&5)! I then redid the camera on the side of the house by back porch (pic6&7). I took both Ring and TP readings - they differed, but that Ring test was the highest I had ever gotten! So, out of curiosity, I went into the backyard by the property line. See the numbers (pic8&9)! I then got on the ladder and redid the center camera. The Ring numbers were off the chart (pic10)! In our house the farthest point was my daughters bedroom. We called it the dead zone. Tonight’s reading seemed unreal, so I tested the speeds with Xfinity’s app. The 3rd numbers down was the speed test before I installed the mesh system. Look at the numbers now. I did it twice just to see if it was a fluke? She’s never had numbers that high, EVER (pic11)!! Lastly, I tested our master bedroom (pics 12&13), used both apps. Once again, amazing numbers! Placing the devices...I ignored the apps suggestions. I ran a hardwire from the back basement room up through a small hole in the first floor where the refrigerator has its water pipe coming up. I placed it on the wall to create a wide range of signal to be able to spread itself out (pic14). I then placed the second one on the 2nd floor in the middle of the hallway (the only outlets we have up there are near the floor (pic15). Signal works great! The 3rd one I placed in our unfinished basement. We do have some outlets higher up on the wall, so I placed it in the middle of the room (pic16&17) to get maximum WiFi coverage without anything blocking the signal. Now, it should also be noted, if you’re still reading this, that we live 10 minutes from the airport and planes fly over our house all the time. It messes with the signal of our WiFi, but not anymore! I swear this system covers every inch of our house with great speeds and extremely strong signal strength. The negative reviews that I read, I really don’t understand what happened in their houses. We used to have the Xfinity pods and they struggled at best and still gave us crappy numbers. This system is worth the money and does what it says! And no, I do not work for TP Link. Honestly, it’s a great system. Is it better than all the others out there? No clue, but it does work like they say it does. And, on mine, the update worked just fine. No issues. For the price and quality of product, I am feeling pretty lucky right now!Read more"

WORTH IT!","This thing has fixed so many issues with our current internet experience. We Live in an area where our only option for Internet is DSL. And it’s not VDSL. It’s the regular, run-of-the-mill, plain Jane, archaic DSL. You know, the stuff that Neanderthals used when they would email each other thousands of years ago. Unfortunately, they are developing the once-rural farmland around us putting many houses in close proximity to us and bringing them up on the same ISP. Our Internet was never great, but it has slowly gotten worse with every new house that goes up. I am in IT and I work for one of the largest healthcare institutions in my state. As such, having consistent and reliable Internet was an absolute must for me. Our entertainment is all “streamed“ in nature. My kids use their phones and gaming systems to communicate with their friends. My husband enjoys his news and entertainment on his phone. But all of these things were getting more frustrating with every passing day. My Internet connection would drop on average about five times an hour during my working day. The ability to stream from Disney+ had all but dried up. We could hardly make it through an episode of Andy Griffith without our signal buffering over half the time. We were exhausting all the data in our cell phone package because our home Internet could not handle reaching the other side of the house in spite of having an extender halfway. I spent hours on the phone with Century Link trying to get “a quicker connection“ and tried various fixes with no success. Century Link sent us new modems to try, supposedly “flipped the switch” to give us a higher speed, but nothing ever made a darn bit of difference.So-I did some desperate research and discovered the concept of “home mesh” and figured I’d give it a try. Holy smokes this set up has made a HUGE difference. No more dropped signals! We can stream just fine all over the entire house; the kids are able to game and we can watch a movie at the same time. It has literally changed our Internet! During my research I found out that an extender basically gives you a totally separate network that you have to bounce back-and-forth between with your originating router network. If you use Sonos or another app that is network-dependent in tandem with an extender, you know that this is a huge pain to deal with! In order to get the app to work correctly on the speakers, you have to be on the same network. This home mesh setup totally resolves that. You stay on the exact same network throughout your entire home. I bought the 5500 square-foot/3 piece set for my 2800 square-foot house. Yes, I’m sure it was overkill, but we have 14 acres and the ability to get Wi-Fi outside is huge. Also, one big hindrance on our previous set up was the fact that we live in a brick home; but this set up flawlessly reaches through the very clunky floorplan of our house (built in the 1960s—>lots of walls!). We have the Century Link-provided C1100Z modem/wireless router manufactured sometime before 2010. In order to make this work I had to do a little bit of home networking: I had to turn off the “wireless router“ portion of the modem and use it strictly as just a modem. Then I hardwired the C1100Z into one of the Decos (doesn’t matter which) and I was off and running. Yes, you do have to use an app to set it up. It’s not hard, though. I did have to reach out to my ISPs technical support to find out what kind of connection I have (static IP/dynamic IP/PPPoE/etc), but it was still super easy. You pick the name of your network, you pick the password, you can even create a “guest network“ for your own home. I highly highly recommend this thing. Especially to someone with the archaic DSL set up like we have. It can be endlessly frustrating to deal with a crappy network and crappy connection. I was convinced that we just did not have any other options other than just dealing with it. But I was totally wrong. Ditch the extender, convert your modem/router to strictly a modem, and buy these things. You will not regret it!Read more"

Excellent feature set inside the app. Parental controls, Port Forwarding, and comes with a 2 year anti-virus.

If you're so inclined, you can still control the advanced settings at your home Internet router.No wiring requirements beyond plugging each unit in and attaching an Ethernet CAT5 cable from your Internet router to 1 of the units. The other units will connect wirelessly. If you have ethernet backhaul throughout your home - that will work too.

Every inch of my home has coverage (about 2,300 square feet over 3 levels) with no noticeable connection lag. Some of my plaster walls are difficult to transmit through and this system overcomes that no problem.Your devices are unaware of which unit they are talking to, the Deco's will take care of all that for you. You just set up one network SSID and connect your devices to it. NO connecting to an EXT network or switching around your wifi network to extended areas.

Easy to set up and use!,"Granted, I just got this router in so I can't speak too much on the reliability yet. However, I will say the looks of it is really nice. It's smaller than my prior router (which I will get into in a bit) and the aesthetics is rather nice. Looks like a futuristic device. Setup was easy especially through the ASUS app. I didn't try logging in with a device plugged in until after it was set up, but again, super easy set up that even a beginner/novice can do. Devices connect wirelessly without a problem and I can't wait to test it out throughout the house. What attracted this particular ASUS router to me was the very fact that it said ""subscription free."" This was attractive because my prior router (which I don't think I'd be allowed to name) stopped working after accidentally unplugging it. I couldn't access it to re-setup my wireless network even after rebooting it and later, trying to reset to factory settings. I called their (the prior router manufacturer) support number for help and they wouldn't even bother unless they charged me $180 - $250 for something they called a ""firewall security renewal."" This wasn't their ""bit defender""/anti-virus thing they have separately. No, they were wanting to charge me for something ridiculous before they would help me. At that point, I just said ""Forget it. I'm not paying that! And I'm never buying any of your routers again if that's the kind of business/scheme you're running."" They didn't seem to care. I came upon this ASUS router on Amazon. Again, the ""subscription free"" part was very attractive to say the least. The GUI was by far more pleasing in aesthetics to look at than the other one, and so far I'm happy overall with this new router. It seems to work better and faster than my prior router (which is old, I know) so that should be a given. If you're looking for a hassle free router with hassle free set up? This might be your go-to.Read more"

Fast, excellent security.","You can verify everything written here is true with a quick google search. Talking to you, Amazon.While ASUS does source some production to China, ASUS is a Taiwanese company and the sticker on the router states “Made in Vietnam”. I’m inclined to believe that. The product origin on this page states “China” but I doubt, and hope, that’s not true. You may not think it matters, but it does more than you might know.Most consumers only care about speed and affordability when it comes to routers, but it should be security at the top of the list. All your data flows through your router, including personal and financial data. Security flaws in your network can also affect neighboring networks around you. If you buy a cheap router based on speed capability alone with security flaws built in, either intentionally or not, you’re basically paying to be hacked, or for your neighbors to be, or possibly unknowingly being a conduit for attacks on your entire country. It has happened in the past, it’s still happening, and will continue to happen.Most routers today are produced in China. Even companies based in the US produce there and it’s very hard to find one that’s not made there. The problem with routers made in China is that ultimately, businesses there are controlled by the CCP government, not the business owner. This allows their government to implement whatever they want in their exported tech and products. It’s why some of their tech companies like Huawei have been banned in numerous countries. Routers made in China from brands like Wavlink which are sold in big retail stores across the US have been found to contain hidden back doors and intentional security holes and vulnerabilities to malware like Mirai. Basically open doors for hackers. Some of these back doors have been used in the past to launch cyber attacks (Mirai botnet) on the US which caused major network outages, as well as in other countries. From a cybersecurity perspective, these look a lot like “trial runs” to me. But speculation and paranoia aside, why take the chance on inviting that kind of tech into your home? It wasn’t an isolated, one time event when these back doors were discovered, and it was with various routers and companies out of China. Again, all this is verifiable with the slightest amount of research using credible sources.I have tried some routers made in China. I could tell they had horrible security just by using the app, or during setup. One was capable of remote access, yet the option to turn it on or off was non existent. It didn’t even ask during set up and the option was nowhere in the app. Remote access should always be turned off, unless you need to access your router from outside your home, which is rarely needed for the average user. If it’s on, it’s just an unnecessary access point open for hackers to attempt access. It might have been possible to check by connecting directly to it using the Web UI, but instead I just returned it and went on the hunt for non-Chinese routers. It took a lot of research since there aren’t many, but finally landed on this one.I am much, much happier with this ASUS router and it seems very security focused! There are numerous security options available in the app, and also asks you about remote access during set up. It has AI Protection by Trend Micro built in (included free of charge) which constantly monitors your network for viruses and intrusions and even blocks harmful websites. You can also monitor all connections and traffic through the app. There are even additional apps you can download for more functionalities.As for speed, WiFi 6 is awesome. This thing is lightning fast to my previous ISP provided router and much more stable. If you’re not familiar with WiFi 6, it’s not really a speed booster. It provides a more stable connection though, even in very signal-congested areas such as apartments or offices where there’s numerous routers and networks overlapping and causing interference. This more stable connection will often times yield higher speeds. Your PC and various hardware must be WiFi 6 capable to utilize it, but there are cheap and affordable USB adapters available to enable it on your PC if it’s not already capable. Aside from that, the 5GHz signal is stable and fast, even without WiFi 6. 2.4GHz is not bad at all either. There are options in the app to monitor what’s connected at all times and you can even limit bandwidth to certain devices, or ban them from connecting completely if you want to streamline your connections.There are a lot more features to this router, which are easily accessed from the app which appears extremely robust compared to the anemic apps I used with the Chinese routers. Those seemed like toys compared to this. I haven’t tried Ai Mesh, but it is yet another useful capability of this router.Completely happy with this router based on speed, stability, capabilities, and most of all, security!Read more"

I bought two because I knew the unit I was purchasing was refurbished and I wanted to have my bases covered in the instance the router was DOA. My ISP came and connected the Fiber to the house and I began the process of connecting the first router. The Orbi app was a breeze to use and everything seemed to be going swimmingly until it came time to actually connect to the wi-fi network.  Each time I clicked ""connect"" it would begin the process and then almost immediately tell me that it was unable to connect to the network.  I followed all of the troubleshooting steps... 3 times... with both systems:1. Turned off cellular data2. Restarted my phone3. Power cycled the router & modemNone of these steps made any difference.  On the second system, the satellite units would not even connect to the base unit.  Their LED lights just blinked continuously searching for the network, which was never found. Finally I broke down and called Netgear support. I was greeted with a foreign accent, something that was not unexpected, and informed that the router(s) I had purchased was 2+ years old and that the warranty only covered a single year. The fact that I had just purchased the unit(s) a few days previously had no effect on the warranty as they told me the warranty did not extend to refurbished units. I was told that I would need to purchase a new service plan in order for them to troubleshoot my system. I decided to return the units and purchase a TP Link router from my local Walmart and it worked out of the box with no issues at all and covered my entire area quite efficiently.Read more"
Smart WiFi,Netgear RBK13-100NAR Orbi RBK13 AC1200 Whole Home Mesh WiFi System Router (Renewed),49.,4.0,278,https://us.amazon.com/dp/B08SKML5C9,5.0,"May 24, 2023",5.0 out of 5 starsSeamless high speed WIFI coverage.,"It is so great being able to move all around the house and not have to wait for (or have to force) the connection to change from one router to the next.  The mesh networks I looked at were really expensive but then I found the refurbished item at $77 for a router and 2 satellites.The set up via the Orbi app was quite straightforward.  I was able to just plug in the cat 5 cable to the router to connect it to the cable modem and power up the router and satellites.  I skipped part of the instructions to power down and power up the cable modem and disconnect all other devices.  I did power down and disconnect the WIFI access point whose SSID I re-used for the mesh.There were a few times where the orbi app required you to go to wifi settings and reconnect to the network to finish the setup.  These times include when you 1) change the ssid from orbi_setup to your preferred ssid, update the admin password, and update the firmware to the latest version.  There might have been a time or two where the app seemed to be spinning its wheels and touching the screen may have (perhaps coincidentally) snapped it out of its navel gazing and moved it to the next stage.All in all happy with the result.  The speed is decent and the coverage is robust.  We have a chimney in the center of the house that is opaque to WIFI and I was able to completely surround it.  The speedtest function in the orbi app is a bit too optimistic on the download speed but seems to match other measures vis-a-vis the upload speed.I have other access points for things like cameras, sensors, and ""smart"" switches/outlets that needed the 2.4 GHz band so I didn't have to spend twice as much for the refurbished 3 band mesh unit and could stick with the two band unit (5 Ghz for user access and 6 GHz backhaul circuit for the satellites.)Read more"

Very easy to set up.,"Previously just had the standard wifi router provided by ATT with fiber connection. It was fine really but some parts of the house lacked good signal. Purchased the 6 Pro E and put the ATT router in bridge mode, the Eero instructions on doing that were perfect and it worked. The 6 Pro E was up and running in minutes and did it's own software updated immediately. Was super easy to rename the network, set the password and permissions and every single device that was previously on the old router connected seamlessly on it's own without any intervention. I think possibly one 2.5GHz device may not have auto-connected but it connected just fine once I put it in pairing mode. We have a lot of devices, mixed 5ghz and 2.5ghz, and so far both networks broadcast fine and everything works. Also 5th Gen Echo Dots seamlessly boost the wifi signal and I already had those in nearly every room before getting the Eero 6 Pro E.Few things to note:I don't pay for Eero Plus subscription so I don't use any of the extra reporting features.New devices connect with what looks like a random code or with a manufacturers name, which usually does not help identify what it is. That can be a challenge when you're trying to figure out if it is something you just added or someone else who managed to get in passed the firewall. Googling the name that shows up does not always help figure out what it is.For some reason my iphone reconnects every few weeks as a ""new device"" with a name of ""unknown device"". This does not happen with my husband's iphone. This means that at any given time there is one active ""unknown device"" and several others that are inactive with that name. Looks like eventually they drop off the recently connected inactive list. Even if I rename it to something specific, after a few weeks it will reconnect as if it's brand new and I'll get an Eero notification that a new device has connected. It is frustrating to have to continually check the app to make sure it's just my own phone and not something intruding.The Eero devices have a Zigbee hub built-in but my recent purchase of motorized Alexa compatible shades with Zigbee motors had issues. They connected sort of, but were not functioning in the Alexa app even though both Eero and the shade manufacturer said they should work. Eventually I had to also buy 2 older 4th gen Echo's that also have a Zigbee hub built-in, only then would they be found by Alexa and then they started working in Alexa app with voice and scheduling.  However, adding the old 4th gen echos created two more issues:  While every single other device in my house on other floors away from the Eero 6 Pro can connect just fine because I have 5th Gen Echos in most rooms boosting the mesh coverage, for some reason, the 4th Gen Echo placed on the second floor could not connect to the 6 Pro E router on the first floor. I had to end up buying a second Eero 6 for the second floor to act as a booster up there as well. Only then did the second floor 4th Gen Echo connect to wifi and stay connected. That's very odd because everything else on the second floor and in the basement and detached garage had no issues connecting to either the wide array of 5th Gen Echos or to the main 6 Pro E on the first floor.  The second new issue... the Eero devices are set to roam automatically which is the point of mesh coverage. However, the Zigbee shades hated that feature and would constantly bounce from the nearest 4th Gen Echo to the 6 Pro E and back. Each bounce made them ""unresponsive"" in the Alexa App. Eventually I had to turn off that roaming feature in the Eero app settings so that every device now connects to whichever Echo or Eero it sees first and then stays there. Defeats the purpose of having mesh but it was the only way to make the $2000 worth of ""smart"" shades actually work with the network and Alexa.Read more"

If you’re on cable, you’re not going to do better than an ARRIS Surfboard. It's rock solid. But ASUS? That’s another story. For a tri-band WiFi 6 router, the range was absolute garbage.Fast forward to my recent move. I switched to AT&T Fiber with the BGW320-500 gateway, and guess what? More disappointment. The UI was terrible, the system was locked down to dual-band, and the range was a struggle. My previous place was a two-story townhome, but now I’m in a one-story home with more square footage plus a larger lot where I plan to install security cameras. The last thing I needed was weak WiFi coverage.After doing my research, I landed on the eero Pro 6E (3-pack). Honestly, I couldn’t be happier.Here’s the thing about the eero Pro 6E: It just works. No complicated setup, no fine-tuning needed. You plug it in, follow a few steps in the app, and that’s it. If you’re the kind of person who loves to tweak every setting on your network, this isn’t the hardware for you. But if you want reliable, high-performance WiFi without the headaches, this is hands-down one of the best mesh systems out there.The range is excellent, the speeds are fast, and I finally have full-home coverage, indoors and out. Whether you’re streaming, gaming, or setting up smart home devices, the eero Pro 6E handles it all effortlessly. On my Apple devices that support 6E, I'm getting more than 1 Gbps up and down on wireless. That's incredible.If you’re tired of routers that promise a lot but underdeliver, do yourself a favor and get the eero Pro 6E. You won’t regret it.Read more"

This is important for many security cams and automated lighting you may use, since the 2.4 can reach farther than the 5Ghz band.I'm 600ft. from my shed and still can stream out there with no issues. The linksys units are all in the house, so yay.Only thing I don't really care for is the status light is on top of the unit.

These are marketed as a consumer product; however, do not have the security features commercial grade products would typically include. That said, this is a top line consumer system with some better features than I have seen on similar products. Set up is super easy with the use of Linksys's app and it provides a strong stable connection throughout my house.One thing I wish I was able to do easily in the parental controls is ban certain websites throughout the network. While this can be done with someone with above average networking knowledge, the app allows you to block sites on a per device only basis.A plus is that this system allows for WPA3 encryption for devices that support it. It also has a feature (Channel Finder) that will scan your networks channels and recommend the strongest channel assignments when things seem a bit off and give you the best performance for your netork. This is very useful for those without the knowledge of how channels work.Overall, I believe this is the best consumer grade mesh system on the market today. In other words, great for home use. The price is a bit too high though, especially considering there are only 4 LAN ports on the back of the device. If you are looking for products for your business (small or large), I would recommend Ubiquiti or SonicWall products. Something I learned for my own business is that commercial equipment does not include a WPS button. However, you do have the ability to turn of WPS functionality on this device and I recommend doing so. How easy would it be for anyone who gained access to your home, either with permission or without, to gain access to your network using the WPS button. Just food for thought.Read more"

It is by far no competition to compete with it.It's the Best router I have ever seen! Lowest levels are old router inside and outside. Highest 500 inside . 477Gbps outside! There are settings in this router, that has antennas to go so far and still have great speed. I am a computer tech and I can actually tell you there is no drop no matter how far you go if you anywhere near your home and it's 3,000 ft even outside you still can go at least a thousand feet and still have range and good speed. I have smart thermostats, smart cameras, fire sticks around 7 of them and smart TVs plus more and all of them never lags. Most routers will go up and down depending on how far you go. This router if you go far it will never lose speed consistency it will always be on this router, that I've never seen that in anything I've used. One thing I noticed the antennas are inside but there is a setting where you can set the range if you wanted to go high medium or low or have it automatic. I keep it on high. There are other settings that I really believe that these antennas are the best and you have all of these other routers that has antennas all around them about 5 to 10 of them that can't handle these antennas that are inside that you can't see. I truly believe that it's because of the amplified antennas that are used because it tells you do you want to make them low to high because of radiation that part scares me. But I see no issues with anything at the moment. If you looking for a router that is by far I do not care what router that you have, just this one router will cover mostly every house you can think of I would say even five thousand feet and you'll never have a problem. Check out my pictures and it will show you the difference between my old router and that new router. And I went much further distances far beyond even outside and got those numbers and I have my router in the middle of my house in a closet. So if I can get those speeds outside of my home thousands of feet away imagine what I get inside of my home. There is no lost of signal when I'm inside my home and I get 5ghz outside of my home all the way down the street!! 5ghz!! It's capped at 2402Gbps Imagine 2.4ghz . And 2.4ghz is capped at 800Mbps!! My service is 500Mbps and I get more than that if I'm close. These numbers you see are far away! Buy this router if you can get it!!Read more"
