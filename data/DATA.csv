5.0,"Super simple to install and works flawlessly. I have the Bluetooth version, so I can only use the app to unlock when I'm within the distance and should have gotten the gateway version, but it connects quick.Read more"

5.0,Easy installation and use. I am so glad we chose this to replace the keyed lock. The app and multiple functions to lock/unlock the door are effective and efficient.Read more
4.0,"Really easy install and if you already have the smart living app set up it's super easy to pair.  Once working it's super easy to configure your pins, fingerprints and wireless doohickeys.The not so great part? I had one unit switch to Chinese and killed my batteries. The easy reset didn't work and I had to unscrew the control unit to press the reset button.  After that, it was a fight to get it to recognize the proper unlock direction.So... This is 4 stars rather than 5 due to the issues i had with that unit.Read more"
5.0,"The media could not be loaded.I wasn’t sure I needed a smart lock until I had one, and now I can’t imagine going back. Between juggling bags, kids, and groceries, having my front door recognize my fingerprint feels like some futuristic magic. The fingerprint sensor works fast and hasn’t failed me yet. It even recognizes my finger when it’s slightly damp from rain, which honestly surprised me.Setup was way easier than I expected. I’m not super handy, but I installed it in under 20 minutes with just a screwdriver and the app. The instructions were clear, and connecting it to the gateway for remote access was painless. Now I can unlock the door from anywhere or set temporary codes when someone needs to stop by. I gave a timed code to a friend who was dropping off a package while I was at work—worked like a charm.Battery life seems great so far (still going strong after a couple months), and I like that I can check battery levels from the app. I haven’t had to use the emergency USB-C backup yet, but I love that it’s there just in case.The peace of mind is the real win. The auto-lock kicks in right after I leave, and the anti-peeping feature is a nice touch when someone’s standing nearby. Between the fingerprint, app, keypad, and even a traditional key if I want, I feel completely covered. I never thought a door lock could make my life feel more together, but this one totally has.Read more"
