# WinPro: A Website for Selecting good Products in E-commerce Through Review Analysis

## Overview 🚀

Online shopping presents a vast array of choices, making it increasingly challenging for both sellers and buyers. Sellers, especially those utilizing cash-on-delivery (COD) networks, face heightened financial risks due to manual selection processes. Traditional methods demand substantial time and resources, necessitating a smarter alternative. This research introduces a methodology enriched with sentiment analysis to streamline product selection. By integrating sentiment analysis with machine learning, it addresses sellers' unique challenges and enhances decision-making precision in the dynamic e-commerce landscape.

## Key highlights :

- **Data Collection**: Collected Amazon electronics reviews using the Scrape.do API, which acts as a proxy + rendering layer to bypass anti-bot measures such as CAPTCHAs. After retrieving the rendered HTML from Scrape.do, we parse and extract review text, ratings, and metadata using requests and BeautifulSoup (bs4). This approach avoids running a local JS renderer and keeps scraping logic simple and reliable
- **Data Cleaning & Pre-Processing**: Employed meticulous data cleaning and preprocessing techniques to refine textual data, including the removal of punctuation and stop words, tokenization, and lemmatization, enhancing the effectiveness of sentiment analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted insightful visualizations and analyses to unravel key patterns and distributions within the dataset, facilitating a deeper understanding of underlying trends.

- **Machine Learning Models**: Explored a diverse range of machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression,and Naive Bayes to discern the most suitable approach for classifying Amazon electronics reviews accurately.

- **Feature Extraction**: Implemented advanced text processing methodologies to convert electronics reviews into numerical vectors, leveraging techniques such as TF-IDF and n-grams to capture nuanced insights.

- **Evaluation**: Employed rigorous evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to meticulously assess model performance. Leveraged grid search techniques to optimize model parameters, ultimately selecting Logistic Regression as the top-performing classifier for our task.

- **Deployment**: Created a user-friendly website with HTML, CSS, and Flask, offering intuitive design and enabling input of Amazon product URLs.

## Workflow Summary

1. **Amazon URL**  
2. **Scraping** using Scrap.do + BeautifulSoup  
3. **Save as CSV**  
4. **Data Cleaning** using Pandas  
5. **Load Pretrained Models** (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression via joblib)  
6. **Sentiment Prediction** (Positive / Negative)


## 📡 Requirements & Scraping Strategy

Web scraping Amazon can be challenging due to strict anti-bot systems such as CAPTCHA, IP blocking, and JavaScript rendering. To overcome these challenges, we used the Scrape.do API, which acts as a proxy + rendering layer for reliable data extraction.

### How It Works

**1.** You send a request to the Scrape.do API with the target Amazon product URL.

**2.** Scrape.do fetches, renders, and returns the fully loaded HTML.

**3.** The project then parses the returned HTML using BeautifulSoup (bs4) and Requests to extract review text, ratings, and metadata.


##  Conclusion: Discussion on Results and Limitations

This project was driven by a simple yet powerful intuition: **customer reviews can serve as a reliable indicator of product quality**. By applying sentiment analysis and machine learning, we successfully built a prototype capable of predicting review polarity with reasonable accuracy.

However, several **limitations** emerged:

- **Small Dataset**: Only 932 reviews were scraped, due to the Scrape.do API’s free tier limit of 1000 requests. This is insufficient for training a production-grade sentiment model. A larger dataset would yield significantly better performance.
  
- **Data Quality**: Reviews may be fake or biased, introducing noise in predictions.

- **Platform Limitation**: Our model is trained only on Amazon reviews and may not generalize to other platforms like eBay or AliExpress.

- **Model Simplicity**: We used traditional ML models (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression). More advanced NLP models (e.g., BERT) could capture context more effectively.

- **Language Limitation**: The current system only supports English reviews.


### 🚀 Future Improvements

To improve this project:

- Scrape larger, more diverse datasets to improve model training.
- Adopt state-of-the-art NLP models like BERT or RoBERTa.
- Extend the system to support multiple e-commerce platforms and languages.
- Add a comparison dashboard for reviewing multiple products side-by-side.
